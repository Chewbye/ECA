'Nima Nourizadeh\'s American Ultra is a bloody valentine attached to a bomb. It\'s violent, brash, inventive and horrific, and perhaps the most romantic film of the year.',positive
'The screenplay is deceptively tight, even as the main characters seem to be buzzing aimlessly through the proceedings. Like the most successful films of the drug-hazed genre, this movie only appears to be going off the rails.',positive
'American Ultra is one of those geeky genre mishmashes that\'s very clever about being dumb.',positive
'Check your brain at the popcorn-butter pump in the lobby and enjoy it.',positive
'That American Ultra works as well as it does is a testament to its two lead performances.',positive
'This is not a spoiler alert; it\'s a tip: If you go to see American Ultra, stay for the credits, right to the end. They are animated and provide a mini fourth act for the film, a little action movie starring a super simian and a beautiful (human) damsel; they are an amusing addendum, but mainly they tell you a lot about where American Ultra\'s heart lies, deep in comic-book territory.',positive
'A lot Bourne and a little bong, the action comedy...is too earnest to be a stoner movie and too quirky to be an action flick. Therein lies the beauty of director Nima Nourizadeh\'s Ultra: It exists to entertain in its own oddball universe, munchies optional.',positive
'It\'s fun in a bad way and bad in a fun way, and that\'ll do for this late in the summer.',positive
'A Bourne movie turned just askew enough to be funny, American Ultra trains a bemused eye on a trope ripe for a ribbing.',positive
'A Walk in the Woods serves as a terrific showcase for two exceptionally durable stars.',positive
'The real pleasures are not to be found in the sweeping shots of the Great Smoky Mountains but in seeing how Mr. Redford and Mr. Nolte\'s characters learn to get along.',positive
'Their odd couple interplay propels a series of shambling, expletive-laden mishaps that aim more for easy laughs than Wild epiphanies.',positive
'It is funny, and Redford, gracious as ever, makes a wonderful straight-man for a comic co-costar who has the face, voice and posture of a geezer who probably should have tackled this healing hike 20 years earlier.',positive
'What A Walk in the Woods doesn\'t have, however, is plot, character development, narrative conflict, and resolution – in other words, a destination.',positive
'A Walk in the Woods is surprisingly funny at times but, like many comedies, it runs out of steam about halfway through.',positive
'It consists of a series of episodic encounters, misadventures, and musings redeemed in part by the presence of two scenic wonders, the unspoiled 2,190-mile grandeur of the Appalachian Trail and the spectacular crapulousness of Nick Nolte.',positive
'These guys still know how to not just hold our attention but grab it, even if their current film needs them more than they need it.',positive
'If Johnny Depp\'s mesmerizing performance — a bracing return to form for the star after a series of critical and commercial misfires — is the chief selling point of Black Mass, there is much else to recommend this sober, sprawling, deeply engrossing evocation of Bulger\'s South Boston fiefdom and his complex relationship with the FBI agent John Connolly, played with equally impressive skill by Joel Edgerton.',positive
'As notorious gangster James Whitey Bulger, Depp astounds with one of the best performances in his long career while co-star Joel Edgerton steps up equally well as John Connolly, an ethically questionable FBI agent who flirts with the wrong side of the law.',positive
'For all of its flaws, it\'s the first film since Eastern Promises that has added anything truly fresh to the old school street-level gangster story.',positive
'Black Mass, a down and dirty crime drama based on the exploits of Boston gangster James Whitey Bulger, is thrilling for a number of reasons.',positive
'While highly entertaining and sometimes inspired, Black Mass is more like Scorsese lite. In perhaps the most memorable sequence, Bulger sardonically tests a childhood friend (Joel Edgerton) for loyalty by teasing out a secret steak sauce in what\'s basically a reworking/homage of Joe Pesci\'s famous I\'m funny, how? scene in GoodFellas.',positive
'This is a good, solid, well-executed crime story. Nothing more, nothing less.',positive
'A solid piece of filmmaking, from subtle beginning to the excessive end.',positive
'As a dramatic thriller, Black Mass has trouble getting into low orbit. There are some tremendous scenes but the narrative as a whole feels more like a chronology of dastardly dealings than the epic tale of a criminal\'s rise and fall.',positive
'If anything, director Cooper is so intent on portraying Bulger as a man, not a monster, the man comes off a little softer than he was, probably.',positive
'Without an emotional core, a stronger sociological angle, or many visceral thrills, Black Mass more or less limits itself to procedural status. Within those aims, it\'s a pretty good one, absorbing and well-made.',positive
'Cooper, the director of Crazy Heart and the underrated Out of the Furnace, has made a tight and tense gangster film with Black Mass. But it\'s a pretty straight-ahead entry in the genre, albeit one peppered with spicy performances.',positive
'The banality of evil was never so hypocritical, so banal and so evil.',positive
'Ice-cold. Dead eyes. Demonic laugh. His face a mask you can\'t read until he\'s up in yours. Then run. That\'s Johnny Depp giving everything he\'s got in a riveting, rattlesnake performance as South Boston gangster James Whitey Bulger in Black Mass.',positive
'Depp\'s performance as Bulger is as strong, and as energized, as anything he\'s done on screen for years.',positive
'Black Mass is a tightly wound piece of work, and Cooper (Crazy Heart, Out of the Furnace) keeps its many small parts moving with ease. He\'s skillful at merging telling, minute details with bigger, looping schemes.',positive
'Depp\'s instinct for observing, underlaying and keeping things in, then letting it all out when required, pays big dividends here in a performance far more convincing than his previous big gangster role, John Dillinger in Michael Mann\'s Public Enemies; it\'s unexpected, very welcome at this point in his career, and one of his best.',positive
'He\'s good, but Depp can\'t quite annihilate the self-consciousness that makes some of his more light-hearted work shine. Too often, it feels like he\'s channeling other actors: here he\'s Jack Nicholson with Hunter S. Thompson\'s nose, there he\'s an Irish-American Ray Liotta.',positive
'By necessity, Black Mass begins in a hole it can never dig out of. It\'s the portrait of a monster told in a flat line.',positive
'Despite Depp\'s seemingly flawless efforts, less may have been more in conveying just how bloodthirsty Bulger was. Where Mass excels is with a stellar cast whose spot on performances keep your interest as the film moves along.',positive
'As a movie, Black Mass often drowns its dramatic potential in a dreary atmosphere and grisly violence used to dubious effect. Depp, however, operates on another level.',positive
'There is nothing underneath the glossy surface and no real insight into what made this man tick — and despite how creepy he looks here, Bulger was a man, not a devil.',positive
'It\'s a well-crafted, well-paced procedural drama about a monotonous psychopath.',positive
'It\'s a solid if not stellar crime drama, well put together, very well acted, and lacking only a genuine reason to exist.',positive
'This is Depp\'s show all the way, featuring his best dramatic performance since another organized-crime movie, 1997\'s Donnie Brasco.',positive
'If the final result doesn\'t transcend emotionally in the manner of the gold standard of Boston noir, Clint Eastwood\'s Mystic River, the fault is not in the execution but the unyieldingly oppressive nature of the underlying material.',positive
'The film, directed with exceptional flair and elegant concision by Scott Cooper, even comes from Warner Bros., the studio that specialized in psychopathic monsters played by such stars as James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson during Hollywood\'s golden age.',positive
'The acting in Black Mass is tremendous.',positive
'Johnny Depp\'s broodingly psychotic turn as convicted Boston crime lord James ‘Whitey\' Bulger is not the only tasty thing about Scott Cooper\'s tale of the unholy alliance between a South Boston Irish mobster and the FBI.',positive
'Scott Cooper\'s Black Mass is a big, brash, horribly watchable gangster picture taken from an extraordinary true story and conceived on familiar generic lines.',positive
'Black Mass is like a playlist of greatest hits from other, better movies.',positive
'Even at a hefty 140 minutes, Bridge of Spies maintains a solid pace. Spielberg\'s mise-en-scène and the streamlined editing of long-time collaborator Michael Kahn are tremendous.',positive
'This covertly brawny film, with a script by Matt Charman and Joel and Ethan Coen, has plot points that click like pegs under Spielberg\'s tight direction. In his fourth pairing with Hanks, Spielberg again examines the furtive face of justice and issues another masterful ruling.',positive
'As the deeply principled Donovan, Hanks deftly balances earnestness and humor. And Rylance\'s spirited performance is almost certain to yield an Oscar nomination.',positive
'The film is an anomaly — a confident, slightly square, highly satisfying example of old-school Hollywood craftsmanship, starring a major movie star brandishing a briefcase, and a handkerchief, rather than a pistol.',positive
'A daring, studied, mannered true story that is at once remarkably genuine and deeply cinematic at the same time. It\'s one of the best films of the year.',positive
'Long, patient and chilling, it vividly captures a time in America and the feel of divided Berlin in the muted blues and greys that color our memories of that duck and cover age.',positive
'I was pleased to see that Spies is not a thriller so much as an ode to both American diplomacy and the tradition of moral movie fathers along the lines of Atticus Finch.',positive
'Solid and uplifting, but it doesn\'t extend Spielberg\'s range. Perhaps one day he will make a movie about a historical character whose complexities are not quite so untainted.',positive
'Bridge of Spies is solid work but feels like Spielberg\'s best intentions as a filmmaker and world conscience on cruise control.',positive
'A movie that underplays its many strengths. You don\'t realize how good it is until it\'s over.',positive
'Bridge of Spies is like Capra with a dash of le Carré.',positive
'Spielberg has an effortless-seeming knack for creating compositions that are not just lovely to look at but integral to the idea or emotion he\'s trying to express.',positive
'Bridge of Spies, Steven Spielberg\'s best film since Saving Private Ryan, stars a flawless Tom Hanks in the smart, old-school thriller as James Donovan.',positive
'You might suggest that Bridge of Spies plays everything a touch safe, and that its encomium to American decency need not be quite so persistent. But when a film is as enjoyable as this one, its timing so sweet, and its atmosphere conjured with such skill, do you really wish to register a complaint? Would it help?',positive
'Hanks could do this kind of role in his sleep; luckily he doesn\'t. Like Spielberg, we probably take him and his gifts for granted. Between the two of them, they make Bridge of Spies a movie that works as a period piece and a timely commentary on how we live now. If that sounds like faint praise, it shouldn\'t. Because it\'s not.',positive
'Bridge of Spies is itself a form of historical whitewashing, albeit one less noxious and harmful than the customary American variety. I liked the movie a lot – it\'s one of Spielberg\'s most measured and most adult films in years.',positive
'This is a handsome and mature entertainment, rich with novelistic intrigue, that asks for very little in exchange for its rewards.',positive
'Gifts of civility small and large mark Steven Spielberg\'s latest film, a deeply satisfying Cold War spy thriller that feels more subdued than usual for the director—even more so than 2012\'s philosophical Lincoln—but one that shapes up expertly into a John Le Carré–style nail-biter.',positive
'A feel-good Cold War melodrama, Bridge of Spies is an absorbing true-life espionage tale very smoothly handled by old pros who know what they\'re doing.',positive
'While the helmer\'s myth-making approach makes for great Capra-esque entertainment, younger auds may find it terribly old-fashioned — and they\'d be right to think so, although Spielberg would be the first to admit it was his intention to play things classical.',positive
'Hanks gives one of his least showy and most credible performances.',positive
'The ever-reliable Hanks sympathetically personifies all in America that is worth fighting for, while his British colleague\'s surprisingly comic version of Rudolf Abel portrays the Russian spy as a man quietly steadfast in his loyalty to a different cause.',positive
'With names like Spielberg, Hanks, and the Coen Brothers, it\'s hard not to be excited about a project like Bridge of Spies. Yet, although the workmanlike production is solidly engaging, it falls short of the loftiest expectations. It\'s worth seeing but not one of the best films of 2015.',positive
'Bridge of Spies tells us that the Constitution is not some quaint national luxury but the road map out of the darkness.',positive
'Most bewildering of all, Bridge of Spies is a moral drama driven by an insurance lawyer. That it works at all is a miracle — or would be, if anyone other than St. Steven were involved.',positive
'Bridge of Spies may be a snooze to the ADD crowd allergic to historical drama, but it\'s dished out by experts.',positive
'While not phenomenal, especially compared to the rest of the Spielberg oeuvre, Spies still hits the spot.',positive
'The movie kicks off with a wonderful setpiece that shows off Spielberg\'s ability to tell a story primarily through visuals — is there any other filmmaker working today better at this?',positive
'Bridge of Spies expands from being a smart, engrossing procedural to a carefully observed character study of Donovan, a particularly intriguing, heretofore overlooked American figure.',positive
'It\'s a riveting film and I understood every word.',positive
'While the rousing tale of espionage has plenty of appealingly old-fashioned qualities, there\'s no doubting Spielberg\'s ability to devise visually arresting moments that speak to the movie\'s themes far better than its story.',positive
'Bridge Of Spies is one-third courtroom drama and two-thirds Cold War thriller, and while an engaging watch thanks to fine actors and terrific filmmaking, it\'s not without its issues.',positive
'If you can overlook the three or four endings of Bridge of Spies, each more overdone than the last, there\'s a lot to like here.',positive
'Bridge of Spies isn\'t conventionally exciting, and isn\'t intended to be. Instead, it\'s satisfying — thoroughly and pleasurably so.',positive
'Like some of Mr. Spielberg\'s other recent movies, notably Lincoln and Munich, this one is a meticulously detailed period piece that revisits the anxieties of the past while also speaking to those of the present. Yet it also feels lighter than those films, less weighted down by accreted history or maybe by a sense of duty to its significance.',positive
'What Spielberg seems to want most from this respectable lark is for audiences to notice the parallels between the 1950s and today.',positive
'Unusually for a Spielberg movie, Bridge of Spies is tonally uncertain.',positive
'It\'s Rylance who keeps Bridge of Spies standing. He gives a teeny, witty, fabulously non-emotive performance, every line musical and slightly ironic — the irony being his forthright refusal to deceive in a world founded on lies.',positive
'For the most part, Spielberg appears content to allow the story (admittedly, a tad bit long) to do the talking, though he goes badly off-track in the sappy ending reminiscent of a Fifties sitcom\'s notions of hierarchy within the American family. Given the Spielberg film canon, it was inevitable. The guy just can\'t help himself.',positive
'The film has a streamlined efficiency, but it feels like the work of a master who wants to please rather than probe.',positive
'Spielberg has taken an important but largely forgotten and hardly action-packed slice of the Cold War and turned it into a gripping character study and thriller that feels a bit like a John Le Carre adaptation if Frank Capra were at the controls.',positive
'Bridge of Spies has a brassy and justified confidence in its own narrative flair.',positive
'Bridge Of Spies turns a secret prisoner exchange between the CIA and the KGB into a tense and often disarmingly funny cat-and-mouse game.',positive
'Bridge of Spies is a consummate professional\'s tribute to a gifted amateur, a smooth entertainment with a strong but subtle political subtext that\'s both potent and unexpected.',positive
'Using a screenplay polished and honed by the Coen Brothers, Spielberg dips into John le Carré territory (you can\'t help but think of The Spy Who Came in From the Cold when Donovan looks onto the newly erected Berlin Wall, in the searchlights, in the snow).',positive
'A mildly entertaining but well acted, sumptuously photographed and smartly written comedy with dark undertones about culinary addiction that can only be called delicious. See it and then check your cholesterol.',positive
'With such a strong cast, the film has the right ingredients but it doesn\'t quite make a perfect meal.',positive
'It\'s not pretty, but it captures something that few cooking movies do: reality.',positive
'Oyelowo and Mara\'s riveting, embodied performances rise above the material.',positive
'The film\'s police-procedural action is unimaginatively presented, but Oyelowo is compelling.',positive
'Crimson Peak\'s atmosphere crackles with sexual passion and dark secrets. There are a couple of monsters (supernatural and human), but the gigantic emotions are the most terrifying thing onscreen.',positive
'Guillermo del Toro\'s latest dive into the darkness is a sumptuous, beautifully constructed tale that feels both archaic and inviting.',positive
'Here\'s the thing about Crimson Peak, which is lurid and ghastly and immensely enjoyable and frequently spectacular and also thinner and less substantial than it wants to be, like a meal eaten in a dream.',positive
'Guillermo del Toro\'s gothic fantasy-romance Crimson Peak is outrageously sumptuous, gruesomely violent and designed to within an inch of its life.',positive
'Del Toro\'s predictably impeccable production design and tonal flourishes help bring the film to life, aided by strong performances from his leads, especially Jessica Chastain, who gives the otherwise reverent proceedings just the right amount of jolt.',positive
'Though this movie waltzes to its own strange rhythm, del Toro hits every note.',positive
'Never entirely satisfying as a drama, Crimson Peak is visually dazzling, boasting lively and at times even transfixing performances that keep the story\'s blood flowing.',positive
'For the two hours it lasted I wasn\'t asking any questions, only giggling, squirming, screaming, and swooning.',positive
'If the film is ultimately an exercise in atmosphere, it is without question a triumph on that front. The rich textures and almost tactile visuals are astonishing.',positive
'Crimson Peak is a cobwebs-and-candelabras chamber piece that\'s so preoccupied with being visually stunning it forgets to be scary.',positive
'Unsurprisingly for a Del Toro film, the production design is the real star of Crimson Peak.',positive
'A ghost story in which superior camerawork, costumes and production design work together to put the audience in a trance. It\'s tough on actors not to get swallowed up in the scenery.',positive
'Guillermo del Toro\'s fussiest, most compartmentalized construction, filled with the most powerful sense of repression and delusion.',positive
'Director Guillermo del Toro\'s unique visual style is on display but the story is predictable, the characters are flat, and the supernatural elements are red herrings. To paraphrase a character, this isn\'t so much a ghost story as it is a story with ghosts.',positive
'This is a film that believes deeply in ghosts, and half of them are in its director\'s head.',positive
'Chastain and Wasikowska take center stage while Hiddleston flutters around like one of Allerdale\'s huge black moths. Watching the women square off within del Toro\'s eye-popping, painterly palette is a feast for the eyes, if not particularly substantial fare for the mind.',positive
'Del Toro reminds us just how chilling bumping into the supernatural is supposed to be, just how stomach churning violence is and just how many shades of red blood shows us, from first spurt to crusty dust.',positive
'While the digital effects are undeniably contemporary, Crimson Peak is otherwise a period homage that mostly plays like a period film, rarely giving in to contemporary notions of pacing and payoff. When the scares do arrive, however, they\'re effectively unsettling.',positive
'Horror is an impatient person\'s game these days, and Crimson Peak isn\'t hurried at all. It seduces with creepily erotic atmosphere, and performances in perfect tune with the script\'s melodrama.',positive
'Beyond its surface pleasures, Crimson Peak also confronts the demons of modern entertainment. The movie frightens and surprises us in familiar ways, but at the same time issues a plea for restraint.',positive
'This is a film of tactile decadence, such a rich sensory experience that it\'s almost suffocating.',positive
'It may be a little overwrought for some tastes, borderline camp at points, but if you\'re partial to a bit of Victorian romance with Hammer horror gloop and big, frilly night-gowns, GDT delivers an uncommon treat.',positive
'Its sombre sincerity and hypnotic, treasure-box beauty make Crimson Peak feel like a film out of time – but Del Toro, his cast and his crew carry it off without a single postmodern prod or smirk. The film wears its heart on its sleeve, along with its soul and most of its intestines.',positive
'It doesn\'t always seem to know what it wants to be. But it\'s still full of marvels.',positive
'This is a movie you feel deeply in the pit of your stomach. Sometimes, it literally hurts to watch it.',positive
'The mountain, grim and unforgiving, remains the star.',positive
'In this case, character development is neglected in favor of awe-inspiring views. There are times when we feel like we\'re on the mountain. Unfortunately, our companions - the men and women populating the screen - are never more than half-formed.',positive
'Director Baltasar Kormákur (2 Guns) and his cast craft a lean narrative tone that humanizes the action without an excess of gloss.',positive
'There have been plenty of mountaineering documentaries over the last few years, and Everest suffers in comparison to them simply by being a dramatization. As realistic as the effects are (and you can occasionally tell when a shot is green-screened), you\'re still aware on a gut level that Jason Clarke and Josh Brolin were not actually filmed at 29,000 feet above sea level.',positive
'There\'s only one star in this movie: Everest. Kormákur couldn\'t shoot higher than base camp, around 14,000 feet, without sickening the actors. But a crew traveled to the top to get footage, while much of the climbing was shot in the Dolomites. No matter. You watch Everest and you believe.',positive
'Based on true events, filled with stunning visuals and featuring more than a half-dozen of our best actors delivering solid performances, Baltasar Kormakur\'s Everest is a high-altitude roller coaster ride that will leave you drained.',positive
'Everest may disappoint those looking for a more awe-inspiring film with big vistas and jaw-dropping stunts and acts of surreal heroism. Unlike many mountain-disaster stories, this is the kind that makes you never want to look at a mountain again.',positive
'Kormakur doesn\'t make the mistake of exalting his subjects as extraordinary individuals, or suggesting that they were obeying some sort of noble higher calling. Everest is blunt, businesslike and — as it begins its long march through the death zone — something of an achievement.',positive
'Director Baltasar Kormakur (2 Guns) essentially made a faux documentary with big stars and better lighting.',positive
'When the lights come up, you don\'t want to feel like you\'ve watched a ­better Cliffhanger. You want to understand the tragedy you\'ve just watched. Yes, you want to be entertained, but you also want the icy, whipping wind of reality to sting.',positive
'Salvatore Totino\'s crisp 3D photography and Kormakur\'s way with a clear, fluid, thrilling action sequence show off the mountain in immensely impressive ways. But the humans involved get short shrift.',positive
'This is what filmed spectacle used to look like — a trip to a place or time most of us could never see.',positive
'There\'s a resemblance here to both the story and the movie adaptation of the story told in The Perfect Storm. The characters involved are making a good faith effort—but good faith efforts by humans can only go so far.',positive
'It feels less like an cautionary adventure movie or the classy Hollywood equivalent of a Reader\'s Digest Drama in Real Life and much more like a disaster epic.',positive
'Everest gets several things right, but it fails to find a way to make the average viewer relate to the people on the mountain.',positive
'A fairly good, extremely grueling movie as far as it goes — tracks the true-life fortunes of a battered group of climbers to the highest place on Earth. Yet somehow it doesn\'t go far enough.',positive
'It lacks the same constant surprises of last year\'s Gravity or the visual poetry of Mad Max: Fury Road, but Kormákur\'s movie nonetheless marks the rare fusion of effective craftsmanship with focused storytelling.',positive
'It succeeds wonderfully, offering moviegoers a rare taste of rarified air -- and as compelling an argument as you can make for seeing a movie writ large on the oversized screen of an actual movie theater.',positive
'Like the mountain for which it\'s named, Everest is rock solid. It\'s big, it\'s beautiful, it\'s terrifying, and it\'s merciless to both its characters and the audience.',positive
'Kormákur creates such a convincing world – the craft of this film is astonishing – that you\'re willing to forgive its less delicate touches in favour of its totally compelling depiction of what it must be like to ascend into a place that\'s heaven one moment and hell the very next.',positive
'With its perilous central premise and gallery of individuals some of whom are destined not to make it, you could say Everest is a disaster movie in the old Hollywood sense of the term, but it doesn\'t feel like one. And that\'s a good thing.',positive
'There is no tragic hero here; there is no overarching explanation, but a movie that offered either of those would seem pretty pat. Take it or leave, Everest is just there.',positive
'Part IMAX nature documentary and part Hollywood disaster movie, it does an effective job of conveying what it\'s like to climb the mountain, the hours and days spent acclimating on practice hikes, and the punishing physical effects that accompany each subsequent change of altitude.',positive
'Perhaps surprisingly, it\'s no better or worse that the other superhero movies of 2015.',positive
'The movie has plenty of the expected fun with its parade of B-movie, VFX-created creatures — a werewolf, giant praying mantis and an army of angry garden gnomes, among them — but it also possesses a sly self-awareness.',positive
'Nonstop mayhem follows in a stampede of comic terrors ready made for Halloween. Sure it\'s exhausting. But Goosebumps, knowing its audience, lets it rip.',positive
'Keeping the creepy/kooky mix entertainingly intact, Goosebumps translates R.L. Stine\'s frighteningly successful young adult horror fiction series to the big screen with lively, teen Ghostbusters-type results.',positive
'Goofily self-aware and wholesomely boisterous, it\'s a children\'s picture whose sense of spooky fun readily diverts from its quibble-worthy messaging.',positive
'There\'s not an ounce of fat on the film. It feels like it moves forward in every single scene, and while it\'s a little mechanical about how it follows three-act structure, it\'s almost charmingly old-fashioned about it.',positive
'Some of the wittier one-liners and more affecting emotional moments feel undermined by the frenzy of chaotic excess.',positive
'This feature adaptation of kid-lit author R.L. Stine\'s best-selling horror-comedy series is out to thrill fans with a story that\'s just as obsessively invested as they are, right down to Black\'s meta casting as Stine himself.',positive
'Goosebumps fulfills its purpose, and that\'s what matters.',positive
'Director Rob Letterman, aided by writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski and Darren Lemke and an energetic cast, rise to the occasion, delivering a movie that\'s a lot of good creepy fun in spite of some dubious construction.',positive
'Pretty much the perfect scary movie for kids.',positive
'The fulcrum to the success of Goosebumps, it must be noted, is the perfect casting of Jack Black as Stine.',positive
'It\'s a never-boring trip to a world, where stories and imagination are powerful tools, that just might inspire kids to do the scariest thing of all: pick up a book',positive
'The movie version of Goosebumps replicates that balancing act. It\'s a cheerful, nasty delight.',positive
'Especially in its superior first hour, Goosebumps has a loose comic rhythm at odds with what we see in effects-heavy would-be blockbuster junk like Pan.',positive
'It\'s tempting to think Hitman undermines any beauty it musters with its habit of ridiculousness.',positive
'If you strip away all the gunplay, Hitman: Agent 47 would be about 10 minutes long.',positive
'Whereas the jokes in the Grown Ups series feel reactionary and bullying, the family-friendly Hotel Transylvania gags (in the script by Sandler and Robert Smigel) instead come off as clever and humane, even when they\'re making fun of helicopter moms and lawsuit-sensitive summer camps.',positive
'The spookiest thing about Hotel Transylvania 2 is how much funnier, colorful and more original it is this second time around.',positive
'This time around, greater attention has been paid to story and character development (while scaling back on all the sight gags) and the substantial results give the ample voice cast and returning director Genndy Tartakovsky more to sink their teeth into, with pleasing results.',positive
'Genndy Tartakovsky returns as director, and the creator of Samurai Jack and Dexter\'s Laboratory has somehow managed to kick up the energy even more for the sequel.',positive
'Jem and the Holograms is one of the weirdest big screen adaptations of a cheap TV cartoon that I\'ve seen. That\'s praise.',positive
'In revisiting the pop rock quest of a multiracial group of adopted sisters in suburban California, Chu has made a stylish and self-aware musical fantasy for the YouTube generation.',positive
'This new Jem might be pure cubic zirconium, but that doesn\'t mean it can\'t be part of a fun night out.',positive
'Katniss and Tris might still be queen bees of the genre, but Thomas (Dylan O\'Brien) and his fellow Gladers find a satisfying, teen-friendly way to combine rebellion, politics, science and a lot of jogging for a broad audience.',positive
'Actually an entertaining action-adventure that not only stands on its own, but surpasses the more limited rewards offered by The Maze Runner.',positive
'Ball and his cast overcome clichés with gusto.',positive
'Minions\' all-silliness all-the-time philosophy will put a smile on faces and keep it there, like a fizzy beverage on a hot afternoon.',positive
'The action sequences are wild, the jokes relentlessly dumb-but-smart, and the sheer sense of anything-goes daftness...is glorious.',positive
'Best yet, there\'s a mid-film bedtime story, made to look like stop-motion, that\'ll take your breath away.',positive
'Many of the jokes are either obvious or have been exposed through pre-release marketing material. I kept waiting for the clever or insightful moment that never arrives. The bar is set pretty low for Minions.',positive
'There can be too much of a goofily good thing.',positive
'I, too, once enjoyed the Minions, in the small doses that they came in. But the extra-strength Minions is, for better or for worse, too much of a good thing.',positive
'Minions will tickle the very young and has roughly twice as many laughs as those Disney Planes pictures, or Pixar\'s Monster\'s University. So Kumbaya, kids, kumbaya.',positive
'The breakout stars of the Despicable Me franchise seize the spotlight in an enjoyably demented off-shoot that is guaranteed to send their young fans bananas.',positive
'A surprisingly demented delight; a crazy, spirited, if simplistic fusion of off-beat adult humour blended with the sensibility of an anarchic toddler.',positive
'All nutty, all nonsensical, all aboard.',positive
'It\'s relentless in its depiction of the slapstick-infused shenanigans that will keep the little ones entranced in their seats.',positive
'Minions lives and dies on its sight gags and luckily for Coffin and Balda they are almost non-stop.',positive
'The good news is that the minions are more (unconsciously, if perhaps also strategically) in touch with their anarchic side than the typical onesie-wearing crusader, which suits the directors Pierre Coffin and Kyle Balda\'s well-tuned sense of the absurd.',positive
'While the minions are certainly little, yellow and different, Minions has probably mined them for about as much comedy as they can provide as leading men.',positive
'Stronger on concept than story, Brian Lynch\'s Minions script emphasizes scale over quantity.',positive
'No Escape is a throwback to an era when movies of this genre were defined by suspense and tension. Dowdle isn\'t interested in providing a safe harbor for those who want a comfortable way to spend two hours. His vision is edgy and exhausting and, for the most part, his execution breathes life into it, tossing a firecracker into the sleepy post-summer movie doldrums.',positive
'The actors do well, with Brosnan playing a kind of James Bond who has fallen into seediness and shady dealings. Bell carries her weight in the emotional scenes and the battles, and Wilson proves (as he occasionally has) that he can do more than be a laid-back comic foil.',positive
'A taut thriller about an American family touching down in an unnamed country just as a violent coup erupts, No Escape goes about its gut-churning business by playing (and preying) on our worst xenophobic tendencies.',positive
'What keeps the movie nervy and kinetic is that, for a good hour, it never seems that Jack and family are anything but average people who somehow manage to survive one hellacious trial after another, even when it comes to having to kill another human being.',positive
'There\'s no denying director/co-writer John Erick Dowdle\'s skill set for creating almost unbearably tense and quite twisted suspense pieces in which you\'ll find yourself laughing at the sheer unapologetic insanity of it all.',positive
'It\'s hardly essential viewing, but No Escape is a tense, at times riveting action-thriller about innocents abroad. Supersize your popcorn, check your logic at the door and settle in for a pretty good ride.',positive
'This should all be risible except that Dowdle, who has worked in the horror genre, knows how to amp the action and keep the terror taut.',positive
'he movie is funny enough to get its share of laughs but, in its angry heart, it\'s a tragedy - and the saddest part is that too much of this story is true.',positive
'Green\'s narrative confidence quickly kicks in, as well as the sharp dialogue by screenwriter Peter Straughan (Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy). More importantly, the film indulges in the unabashed goofiness that stoked Green\'s Pineapple Express, and which Sandra Bullock demonstrated to raucous effect in The Heat.',positive
'Though not without its entertaining moments—the cast, led by Sandra Bullock, is energetic, sharp and gets a fair number of juicy bits to rock out with. But as a whole, Our Brand is Crisis is a messy affair that sputters along when it should be humming with assured cynical momentum.',positive
'Jane is a genius, but she\'s deeply flawed and complicated, struggling with substance abuse, mental illness, her own past regrets. That dark underbelly adds depth and dimension to the ironic humor of Our Brand is Crisis.',positive
'Provocative, intelligent but just a bit underwhelming, Our Brand Is Crisis — inspired by a 2005 documentary of the same name — plays as if the filmmakers started out with Oscar aspirations but ultimately weren\'t up to the challenge.',positive
'Director David Gordon Green and screenwriter Peter Straughan sometimes stumble over this vast terrain of self-serving scoundrels (Trump trumps anything they can make up), but the laughs keep firing.',positive
'The film is at its best when the storyline gets dangerously real and Bullock\'s character struggles to justify the back room king making of a campaign with the needs of the country\'s poor majority.',positive
'Green wisely cedes control to his actors, with Bullock as the main engine pulling the material along. But neither his direction, nor any of the formidable performances, can do much to alleviate the bumpy road of Peter Straughan\'s screenplay.',positive
'Our Brand is Crisis hits a lot of clunky notes and the end is unforgivably cornball, but it\'s still one of the liveliest political black comedies I\'ve seen in a while. The pacing is lickety-split, the talk is boisterous, and the cast is all aces.',positive
'David Gordon Green\'s Our Brand Is Crisis is a horror film wrapped in fast-talking political comedy.',positive
'As played by Sandra Bullock, Our Brand Is Crisis political spin doctor Jane Bodine is easily one of the best female roles of the last 10 years.',positive
'Wright\'s best film so far, livelier and more disloyal to its source than Atonement or Pride and Prejudice — crams without a care. The outcome is that increasing rarity, a proper children\'s film; even the tears are well earned.',positive
'This Pan is loud, colourful, busy and full of ideas. Not all those ideas work in sync – but most are bold and some are winningly eccentric.',positive
'Occasionally things get a little overcrowded, particularly during a sticky final act, but Pan has a certain timeless buoyancy that keeps it bouncing back.',positive
'Full of non-stop action, an intriguing new take on J.M. Barrie\'s classic Peter Pan tale and some old-fashioned, swashbuckling mischief led by Hugh Jackman, director Joe Wright\'s Pan is one heck of a charming romp.',positive
'The film fulfills its limited mandate of providing fast-paced adventure and some nice eye candy without adding anything memorable to the tale of The Boy Who Can Fly.',positive
'Working from a screenplay by Jason Fuchs, director Joe Wright seems overwhelmed by the material, and he fails to make us care about any of the characters.',positive
'Passable adventure that offers the occasional flash of real cleverness.',positive
'Because Demme genuinely likes people and is interested in them, Ricki and the Flash feels like Stella Dallas as remade by Jean Renoir — it\'s a humanist suburban fable.',positive
'If you\'re wondering whether you\'ll believe Streep is a convincing rock musician, please. It\'s Meryl Streep here. She sounds like she\'s ready to open for Bruce Springsteen.',positive
'Regardless of its flimsy emotional interior, Ricki is a worthy addition in this year\'s growing canon of strong female-centred films.',positive
'Although sweet and likable, Ricki and the Flash pulls too many punches to qualify as cathartic or even memorable. Instead, it\'s a crowd-pleaser every bit as calculated and earnestly defanged as a Golden Oldies bus-and-truck tour.',positive
'Director Jonathan Demme grasps the well of feeling of Diablo Cody\'s script and eventually harnesses it in his own image.',positive
'Streep is positively effervescent in the part, sassy and in good voice (the acoustic Jenny Lewis cover is spot-on). And for all its overly-familiar notes, Ricki and the Flash rarely seems out-of-tune.',positive
'A movie that gives Streep her most emotionally blocked character in years, without caricature.',positive
'Though this is the cinematic equivalent of an album of cover tunes by artists who have created much more dazzling original work, it\'s a sweet, smart and funny confection.',positive
'It\'s an entertaining diversion - a good way to pass a couple of hours as late summer evenings lengthen - but not much more.',positive
'Quite a few filmgoers lament the shortage of movies for adults. Ricki and the Flash goes against that trend with rock \'n\' roll attitude.',positive
'Ricki And The Flash is a movie of things that may have been done better earlier — sometimes by Demme himself — but which are done all too rarely nowadays, which makes it feel both retro and refreshing.',positive
'When Ricki and the Flash pierces its conventional trajectory with music, it gets more interesting. But the fluff surrounding it holds together well enough.',positive
'A breezy but touching dysfunctional family dramedy, with real heart and some genuine musical soul.',positive
'Director Jonathan Demme and screenwriter Diablo Cody, both Oscar winners, have made far better films. Still, Ricki raises smart questions about why a mother\'s musical ambitions are so much more selfish than, say, seven-time dad Mick Jagger\'s.',positive
'Baby it\'s a wild film, but not Murray\'s best and not Levinson\'s either.',positive
'Director Barry Levinson and screenwriter Mitch Glazer lucked out getting Bill Murray to play Richie Lanz, a loser who makes losing hilarious. Murray just kills it.',positive
'The film, as entertaining as it is, doesn\'t exactly further a genre that has been stale since the success of 2013 rom-zom-com Warm Bodies.... What\'s promising about Scouts Guide, though, are its unlikely heroes.',positive
'Shaun the Sheep might look like an exciting, no-nonsense tale for little kids — and it totally is, on one level — but beneath its pitch-perfect simplicity lies great wisdom and beauty.',positive
'Pixar might have uncovered the mysteries of our brains with Inside Out. But Aardman knows its way around our funny bones.',positive
'Anyone who doesn\'t have a grand time watching Shaun the Sheep Movie is suffering from a fractured funny bone that needs to be reset.',positive
'Like a great amusement park ride, Shaun the Sheep Movie is consistently enjoyable.',positive
'From the company that gave us Chicken Run and Wallace and Gromit, this adorable tale about a sheep who leads his comrades on a big-city adventure is some of the most pure visual storytelling you\'re going to see this year.',positive
'It is sophisticated yet innocent, and while always accessible for young fans it never suffers from a lack of dialogue, with the straightforward and breezy story easy to follow and fun to enjoy.',positive
'Maybe an hour would have been enough, but even the slower patches have charm to burn.',positive
'A Lower key than Wallace and Gromit or Pirates, but tightly packed with charm',positive
'The Aardman vision of contemporary England is generous, inclusive and - if a fast-moving film about a smart-alec sheep can allow itself such grandiose ambitions – genuinely inspiring.',positive
'The wonder of stop-motion is the mountain of effort required to achieve even the smallest movement. The charm of Shaun the Sheep is that you don\'t notice it for a moment.',positive
'Though realized on a more modest scale than other Aardman features, the film is still an absolute delight in terms of set and character design, with sophisticated blink-and-you\'ll-miss-it detailing to counterbalance the franchise\'s cruder visual trademarks.',positive
'There\'s something refreshing about the old-fashioned way in which it entertains, a mix of silly slapstick and sight gags combined with a gentle heart.',positive
'Clocking in at a slim 85 minutes, the whole thing flies by quite pleasingly, a warm and funny feature that reasserts the value of high quality visuals and attention to detail.',positive
'This delightful stop-motion animated romp features no dialogue, which is as it should be – the beauty of animals is in their actions, not words, after all.',positive
'The stop-motion technique never ceases to fascinate, but the episodic structure of Shaun the Sheep Movie hinders any true emotional buildup and payoff.',positive
'Like in so many silents, the plot is joyously minimal.',positive
'The lack of dialogue makes Shaun The Sheep easy for younger children all over the world to understand, and the film is undeniably intended for that demographic.',positive
'As with other Aardman productions, the greatest delights derive from relishing the details of the clay figures and intricate sets, crafted by the studio\'s master model builders.',positive
'Short, sweet, charming and often very funny, Shaun the Sheep Movie has essentially no intelligible dialogue and doesn\'t need any.',positive
'It has generous lashings of Aardman Animations\' trademark warmth, visual inventiveness, and satisfying Claymation tactility.',positive
'In a movie culture with near-inescapable CGI, old-fashioned animation like Shaun the Sheep is always a treat — and a romp this ambitiously aimless is an all-too-rare marvel.',positive
'A charming and clever concoction.',positive
'Co-director Starzack was one of the guiding hands behind the series version of Shaun the Sheep, and that experience in the kind of brisk, skit-based comedy that makes the series so charming shows through here in stand-alone scenes.',positive
'In a bold move that pays off, the movie jettisons dialogue altogether and tells its whole story through barn-animal noises, goofy sound effects, and sight gags so silly they\'d make Benny Hill spin in sped-up ecstasy. The effect is contagiously cute.',positive
'Playful, absurd and endearingly inventive, this unstoppably amusing feature reminds us why Britain\'s Aardman Animations is a mainstay of the current cartooning golden age.',positive
'The movie is a world-class winner.',positive
'Like a great silent movie, it creates its pathos and comedy out of the concrete objects being animated, building elaborate gags involving everyday items transformed into Rube Goldberg devices that sometimes entrap the characters, or, when properly manipulated by them, provide a means of achieving their goals.',positive
'A dialogue-free romp that is a shear delight, shear perfection, if not quite a master-fleece.',positive
'Shaun the Sheep Movie delivers exactly what it promises: The cutest, most innocuous entertainment this side of Internet panda videos.',positive
'Shaun the Sheep Movie manages to be smart, moving and hilarious without the inclusion of a single word of dialogue.',positive
'Pulled from the news but punched up to fever pitch, Sicario represents the perfect mix of cerebral and visceral thrills. Star, director and screenwriter all bring their A-game.',positive
'Sicario is a tentacled drug cartel thriller grabbing viewers by the throat and squeezing for two hours. This movie continually defies the conventions of its genre, from its hero\'s gender to the vagueness of its morality.',positive
'What keeps Sicario from cynicism is the nature and depth of Villeneuve\'s gaze, not childishly wide-eyed but capable still of feeling pain. He\'s a terrific director. You know that if his heroine, Alice, gets out of Cartel-land alive, she might spend a few months in an asylum, but she\'ll be back, hell-bent on seizing the foreground.',positive
'Sicario is an ambush, a low-slung film about a dirty drugs war with Mexico which challenges and engages in equal measure. It moves with grim tenacity, confounding expectations until its very final sequence.',positive
'Those who go to a Villeneuve production, Sicario included, must be prepared for intense suspense, moral ambiguity, and an ending that doesn\'t conform to Hollywood norms.',positive
'The sound never loses its urgency, its sense of immediate danger, straight through to the closing shot of the film.',positive
'Villeneuve (Prisoners, Incendies) once again proves he can craft a gripping tale that never collapses under its own moral weight. Sicario is not an easy film to watch, but it is a riveting and essential one.',positive
'Sicario, which combines dizzying action scenes with a taut script, ravishing photography and an otherwordly musical score, is a knockout.',positive
'In Spanish, sicario means hitman. In film terms, Sicario is sensational, the most gripping and tension-packed spin through America\'s covert War on Drugs since Steven Soderbergh\'s Traffic 15 years ago.',positive
'Sicario calls to mind the films of the 1970s — not necessarily the ones we think of as capital-I Important, but the seamy, sweaty thrillers that subtly slipped in anti-establishmentarian messages amid the violence. It mixes arthouse and grindhouse into a most satisfying cocktail.',positive
'Sicario starts and ends with Blunt\'s impassioned performance (and she\'s spectacular in her final scene), but it\'s Del Toro who is the real standout.',positive
'There are no winners here. Maybe that\'s cynical, or maybe it\'s true. But it\'s a bleak and sometimes powerful message that Villeneuve delivers with blunt force.',positive
'A beautifully murky, hard-edged thriller. Quite simply, one of the best films of the year.',positive
'Rather than a birds\'-eye procedural about a complex international mission, it\'s a close-up of that mission from the point of view of the participant who understands it the least.',positive
'This dramatic thriller finds a spot somewhere between your brain and your stomach, and drills in.',positive
'Sicario is a queasy-making thrill ride through Dick Cheney\'s Theme Park on the Dark Side, with an enjoyable cast headed by Blunt, Josh Brolin as a bro-tastic but oddly sinister secret agent in flip-flops and Benicio Del Toro as a person of uncertain provenance (is he Mexican? Is he Colombian? Is he CIA?) who is approximately the scariest guy ever.',positive
'If Sicario does not collapse under its own grimness, that is because of the pulse: the care with which Villeneuve keeps the story beating, like a drum, as he steadies himself for the next set piece.',positive
'Each set piece is orchestrated with aplomb - a raid on a tunnel under the border being a particular stand out - but Sicario is kept grounded in reality. Villeneuve keeps his focus tight on his small group of characters and though the plot is complex, it fits the Byzantine intricacies of the problem and the obscure motivations of the operators.',positive
'Blunt\'s performance has an edge of steel. She brings off a mix of confidence, bewilderment and vulnerability, which functions very well against the alpha male characters higher up the chain of command.',positive
'Sicario is at its best when its borderlines are fluid and indistinct.',positive
'I\'m not sure if leavening is the right word, but Brolin, as an enigmatic U.S. agent with a world-weary cynicism and a black-ops vibe, provides at least a dose of (very) dark humor to the proceedings.',positive
'If at any point in Sicario, you feel lost, don\'t worry about it. The movie is all about being lost and, in any case, all becomes clear, eventually.',positive
'Every scene of calm, potentially, is trip-wired for an explosion. But for all its chilling tension and horrific imagery, Sicario is also a beautiful movie.',positive
'It\'s an unusual mix of big-picture issues, grindhouse pulp and pure, rough entertainment, bolstered by one of the better ensemble casts of the year. This movie is not, um, fussing around.',positive
'Sicario doesn\'t fall apart in its second half, exactly, but it does settle for less than it should.',positive
'At times, Sicario is a deeply satisfying, intense examination of a war with no rules of engagement, driven by a spectacular performance by Benicio Del Toro and typically mesmerizing cinematography from Roger Deakins. At other times, especially in its middle act, Sicario can be frustratingly self-indulgent.',positive
'Denis Villeneuve\'s film views life in the age of the modern-day drug war as an ever-crescendoing existential nightmare.',positive
'Amazing to look at, amazing to listen to, yet just a bit underwhelming to really think about, Sicario Denis Villeneuve\'s Mexican drug cartel drama is superlatively strong in every conceivable way except story.',positive
'Though Villeneuve magnifies the pervasive dread surrounding the modern drug war, he\'s better at conveying the thrill of creeping through that battlefield than the complex set of interests sustaining it.',positive
'Making a film with fine performances, adept direction, first-rate photography and a doltish screenplay is like starting a rock band with no drummer. The result may yield satisfying, even memorable moments. But every time you try to build momentum, the project falls apart.',positive
'The dark nihilism of Sicario masks a reliance on easier solutions, ones we\'ve been fed by decades of genre films and that feed our need for justice dispensed with violent, vengeful directness. The movie promises to clear the fetid air around the drug wars. In the end it\'s just another drug.',positive
'It\'s an uncommonly bold gambit, expressly designed to frustrate people who want to see a strong woman deliver a righteous ass kicking. The progressivism here is instead rooted in futility and despair, which provides much more of a valuable shock to the system.',positive
'With a taut and timely screenplay by Taylor Sheridan, Sicario is a brilliant action thriller with the smarts of a message movie.',positive
'The opening of Sicario unfolds at such an anxiety-inducing pitch that it seems impossible for Villeneuve to sustain it, let alone build on it, but somehow he manages to do just that. He\'s a master of the kind of creeping tension that coils around the audience like a snake suffocating its prey.',positive
'The violence of the inter-American drug trade has served as the backdrop for any number of films for more than three decades, but few have been as powerful and superbly made as Sicario.',positive
'The violence is shocking, effective and soaked into the dry brown landscape.',positive
'By turns thrilling, disorienting and draining, Sicario exists in a border zone seemingly of its own devising between the art film and the action movie.',positive
'One of the great satisfactions of Spectre is that, in addition to all the stirring action, and all the timely references to a secret organization out to steal everyone\'s personal information, we get to believe in Bond as a person.',positive
'It\'s a feat of pure cinematic necromancy.',positive
'It\'s business as usual, even if that business is pulled off with brilliant precision, ingeniously choreographed action, and an itinerary boasting some of the most photogenic spots on Earth.',positive
'Spectre isn\'t bad — just slightly disappointing.',positive
'This is the 24th Bond film and it ranks solidly in the middle of the all-time rankings, which means it\'s still a slick, beautifully photographed, action-packed, international thriller with a number of wonderfully, ludicrously entertaining set pieces, a sprinkling of dry wit, myriad gorgeous women and a classic psycho-villain who is clearly out of his mind but seems to like it that way.',positive
'For all its workmanlike devotion to out-of-control helicopters, Spectre works best when everyone\'s on the ground, doing his or her job, driving expensive fast cars heedlessly, detonating the occasional wisecrack, enjoying themselves and their beautiful clothes.',positive
'Anyone who has tamped down that youthful yen for excitement should stay away. But the craving for grownup glamour, however foolish, demands equal satisfaction, and Spectre, in providing it, acquires a throb of mystery that cannot be explained by mere plot.',positive
'The new James Bond movie Spectre makes a satisfying final chapter to the four-film saga of Daniel Craig\'s 007, even if that saga turns out to be less than the sum of its parts.',positive
'It remains a decently robust and entertaining midlevel Bond movie — just one that\'s haunted by the specter of its predecessor.',positive
'Spectre is still fun, the cast is top-flight. And had it been the first Bond film with Craig in the title role, the reaction likely would be wow! This is some good stuff, way deeper than the silly Bonds. But with history behind us, it feels a little slight.',positive
'In the end, Spectre is just too much of a good thing. Though each scene is carefully wrought, there\'s little grace, majesty, or romance in the way the pieces are connected. The whole is bumpy and inelegant — entertaining for sure, but hard to love.',positive
'What\'s missing is the unexpected emotional urgency of Skyfall, as the film sustains its predecessor\'s nostalgia kick with a less sentimental bent.',positive
'It\'s deeply silly but uproariously entertaining. At the end, I almost felt guilty for enjoying it all quite so much - almost.',positive
'Bond has seen it all before, this team has done it all before, and the production juggernaut hits every beat with a carefully calibrated precision which can be deeply satisfying but also risk coming across as rote.',positive
'Not bad, no need to wake Roger Moore from his mid-morning nap and bring him out of retirement, but not special.',positive
'It\'s possible that Skyfall created expectations that were too high for Spectre to match. But with all he\'s done for the franchise, Craig deserves to go out with a bigger, smarter bang.',positive
'What Spectre lacks is the sinister magnetic pull of Skyfall, a Bond movie with real stakes and attitude and distinctive flavor, not to mention more mesmeric images than one can usually expect from this workmanlike blockbuster franchise.',positive
'Spectre is a frustratingly unsatisfying experience.',positive
'The clichéd ghosts of James Bond past haunt Spectre, an action adventure whose biggest failure is looking back on 007\'s own success.',positive
'All of its revisionism centrally incorporates the history of the franchise, and the film both excels and suffers for frequently recalling its forbears.',positive
'It\'s filled with big sets, big stunts, and what ought to be big moments, but few of them land.',positive
'Craig puts heat and heart into Spectre, as if he\'s taken Bond as far he can. The movie is a fever dream of all the Bond villains and all of Bond\'s efforts to see a life past them.',positive
'This sophisticated sugar rush is the longest Bond film ever, but it cruises by with an elegant sense of danger. As with all of Daniel Craig\'s 007 outings, it amps up the intelligence and tamps down the attitude.',positive
'Craig is cruelly efficient. Dave Bautista makes a good, Oddjob-like assassin. And while Lea Seydoux doesn\'t leave a huge impression as this film\'s Bond girl, perhaps it\'s because we\'ve already met — far too briefly — the hypnotic Monica Bellucci, as the first real Bond woman since Diana Rigg.',positive
'Though not as dramatically rich or emotionally compelling as Skyfall, Spectre still ranks as a sleek, pulse-pounding if slightly overlong entertainment.',positive
'Even if this is less satisfying overall than Skyfall, there are sequences that rank with Bond\'s best.',positive
'A Bond movie is all about delivering on expectations: to enjoy it you have to be pleased rather than frustrated by its predictability. In that regard, Spectre, Daniel Craig\'s fourth outing as Bond and the second directed by Sam Mendes, can be deemed a solid success: not as darkly stylish as Skyfall but not as stupidly grim as Quantum of Solace either.',positive
'Spectre is the most traditional of the Craig Bonds. Although a little light on gadgets, it has everything else,',positive
'I don\'t want people to dislike me. I\'m indifferent to if they dislike me, says Jobs. Well, this won\'t be for everyone but it dazzles. Markedly better than Ashton Kutcher\'s Jobs…',positive
'Really smart people on a really smart person: Fassbender, Winslet, Sorkin and Boyle await Oscar nominations. But for all its relevance and grandeur, Steve Jobs is ridiculously entertaining. You might say, user-friendly.',positive
'It\'s no discredit to Steve Jobs, Danny Boyle\'s propulsive and iconoclastic biopic of the digital-revolution visionary who democratised personal computing, that it\'s a dispiriting study of capitalistic self-aggrandisement – one that leaves a sense of unease despite its ironically upbeat ending.',positive
'Racing in high gear from start to finish, Danny Boyle\'s electric direction tempermentally complements Sorkin\'s highly theatrical three-act study.',positive
'Writer Aaron Sorkin, director Danny Boyle and star Michael Fassbender have given their subject the brilliant, maddening, ingeniously designed and monstrously self-aggrandizing movie he deserves.',positive
'Sorkin smashes the cradle-to-grave biopic mold with Steve Jobs. R.I.P., I guess. It\'s called a mold for a reason.',positive
'As original and risk-taking as its subject, Steve Jobs will make you think differently about an American icon.',positive
'It strips away the myth and icon and reveals Jobs for the hustler-huckster he was, just a smooth, smiling turtleneck, trying to sell us something. In many ways, his film makes all other Jobs movies unnecessary.',positive
'Screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and director Danny Boyle aren\'t interested in offering another re-enactment of the truth-is-stranger-than-fiction story. They have something more ambitious in mind. Their goal is to illustrate the tyranny of genius and how a great mind doesn\'t always mean a great person.',positive
'As can be said of most Apple products, it\'s a wonder to behold — despite a few irritating glitches.',positive
'Sorkin\'s script is clever and knowing — at one point late in the proceedings, Jobs wonders aloud why everybody gets drunk and takes him to task five minutes before every event. It\'s a small moment that breaks the fourth wall in the slightest and smartest of ways.',positive
'This a super-Sorkiny Aaron Sorkin script — full of the kind of well-timed zingers and clever turns of phrase that never occur to us in real life.',positive
'Propelled by an ingenious script by Aaron Sorkin, given vibrance and buoyancy by director Danny Boyle, Steve Jobs is a galvanizing viewing experience.',positive
'For most of its two hours it\'s brainy, high-speed entertainment, but the filmmakers are not quite as smart as they think they are. For all its flash and hypertalk, Steve Jobs is an old-school movie in new-style camouflage.',positive
'The tension between Boyle\'s restless energy and Sorkin\'s tendency to run in place drives the movie.',positive
'While at times too over-the-top and operatic for its own good, those same flawed ingredients echo the rough edges that define the movie\'s iconic subject.',positive
'Boyle, Sorkin and company might not have invented the iPhone or changed the way people viewed technology, but it does something the real Steve Jobs had trouble doing: It offers a genuine peek at the man behind the turtleneck, and in the process finds a way to connect with its viewers.',positive
'The dichotomy turns out to be a false one: whether you revile him or genuflect before him, you are still implying that the guy demands and deserves our fascination. What Sorkin and Boyle have to offer is not a warts-and-all portrait but the suggestion that there is something heroic about a wart.',positive
'It\'s all too neatly staged to make for dynamic cinema, even if the dialogue does crackle with a delicious nastiness.',positive
'In many ways the film reflects its hero\'s brilliance. It\'s a scintillating construction, though one that sometimes feels like a product launch in its own right.',positive
'This is a swift and searing attempt to pull back the curtain on Jobs and, in the process, investigate the relationship between the myth and the man.',positive
'Steve Jobs the movie is a lot like Steve Jobs the person: astonishingly brilliant whenever it\'s not breaking your heart.',positive
'Danny Boyle\'s movie is meticulously crafted to artful specifications, written in Aaron Sorkin\'s torrential style and acted to perfection by a superb ensemble. Yet like Jobs\' NeXT Cube in 1988, there\'s one obvious question that isn\'t satisfactorily answered: What does it do?',positive
'It\'s a moving and magnificently crafted story about a person named Steve Jobs who was brought low by pride and arrogance and then redeemed by love. It might be a story that mirrors our dreams and desires, which is what the real Steve Jobs did too, and in that sense maybe it\'s indirectly about him. It\'s definitely not about a guy who built and sold computers.',positive
'Is Steve Jobs a great film? I don\'t think so. It\'s an achievement, certainly, full of Sorkin flourishes, breathtaking and brilliant one-liners that reveal a lot about the characters who deliver them.',positive
'To be sure, Steve Jobs has its own integrity as the story of the young innovator, but it\'s a little like making a movie about Thomas Edison and stopping somewhere between the phonograph and the lightbulb.',positive
'Steve Jobs is a tale of two men, not one: A more accurate, not to say wittier, title would have been Steve Jobs and Aaron Sorkin.',positive
'As sharp and slick as Steve Jobs is, it ends up feeling more interested in entertainment than enlightenment.',positive
'Sorkin\'s voice dominates the discourse and the film rarely has a chance to catch its collective breath. While you have to give the duo credit for attempting an unconventional structure, it\'s a choice that arguably only works thanks to the contributions of a stellar ensemble.',positive
'The first act is a thing of beauty and the second, good enough. Shame about that third act, though, and the ending that retroactively diminishes everything that preceded it.',positive
'A movie that feels like a series of beautifully and meticulously crafted tiles in a half-finished mosaic; you can admire the pieces but still come away feeling like you\'ve been deprived of the whole.',positive
'It\'s exhausting, impressionistic, and ultimately hollow, extraordinarily well-acted but not nearly as relevant as The Social Network.',positive
'We don\'t go to Hollywood movies for hard facts, but it\'d be nice to think we\'re getting some kind of truth with our entertainment. Maybe Aaron Sorkin thinks we can\'t handle the truth.',positive
'The movie, a formidable technical and design achievement, has everything going for it except a sense of Jobs\' inner life.',positive
'If you\'re going to interpret on film the searching mind of an indisputable genius, it helps not to make too many dumbass moves. On that basis, score a triumph for Steve Jobs, written, directed and acted to perfection, and so fresh and startling in conception and execution that it leaves you awed.',positive
'Steve Jobs, which by many accounts plays loose with the facts, is at its weakest when it tries to humanize its protagonist.',positive
'Steve Jobs is a smart, hugely entertaining film that all but bristles with crackling creative energy. What it is not is a standard biopic.',positive
'Steve Jobs is a rich and potent document of the times, an expression of both the awe that attends sophisticated new consumer goods and the unease that trails in the wake of their arrival.... Mostly, though, it is a formally audacious, intellectually energized entertainment, a powerful challenge to the lazy conventions of Hollywood storytelling and a feast for connoisseurs of contemporary screen acting.',positive
'A deliriously quick-footed and orchestrally pitched character study, Steve Jobs is an ambitious, deeply captivating portrait of the high cost of genius.',positive
'What Boyle and Sorkin are after here is a portrait of Jobs, not a photograph. And they have succeeded in making one, in wildly entertaining fashion.',positive
'The film\'s tension comes partly from a raft of terrific performances — everyone\'s good, and Fassbender\'s stellar — and partly from juxtaposing Jobs\' public and private personas. He could make cheering audiences believe he was changing the world, but backstage ... not so much.',positive
'Straight Outta Compton is among the most potent rags-to-riches showbiz movies ever made.',positive
'It plays like a Marvel superhero movie had Marvel been run by Suge Knight.',positive
'Straight Outta Compton is a hugely entertaining film that works best if you don\'t look at it too closely and just listen.',positive
'Both of its time and of the moment, Straight Outta Compton is potent and largely successful, and makes a hell of a case for why this was a story worth telling.',positive
'Straight Outta Compton proves as infectiously entertaining as it is educational thanks to F. Gary Gray\'s richly textured direction and a thumping soundtrack that confirms rap as the protest music of its time.',positive
'Potent and visceral in its depiction of street life and blinged-up excess alike, Straight Outta Compton delivers big beats of both kinds.',positive
'Straight Outta Compton is, undoubtedly, a nostalgia trip, but, this being NWA, it\'s one you take in a \'64 Impala with height-adjustable suspension. It\'s a loud, stylish ride.',positive
'A sprawling, overstuffed, formulaic but highly entertaining story of pop stardom.',positive
'No movie could capture all the alarming incidents and contradictions that make up the complete N.W.A. story. But in order to stress the group\'s most righteous side, the movie downplays their youthful excesses as well as their flagrant sexism.',positive
'Buoyed by a soundtrack that\'ll have fortysomethings cracking open 40-ounces and recalling a marginally simpler, if still chaotic, time in their lives, Straight Outta Compton\'s bark is just as snarly-cool as its bite. Take that, Tipper Gore.',positive
'Even with the film\'s mild flaws and arms-wide-open approach, it tells a powerful, engaging and compelling story of how America challenged and changed five young black men, and how they in turn challenged and changed America.',positive
'Straight Outta Compton reminds viewers not only who N.W.A. were and what they meant, but also why they mattered — and still do.',positive
'Within the vigorous entertainment of Straight Outta Compton is a sharp-minded realism about the machines within the machines, the amplifiers of money and media that, behind the scenes and offscreen, play crucial roles in the flow of power.',positive
'It\'s overlong and sanitized but succeeds in presenting an important part of contemporary American culture to a mainstream audience.',positive
'Now in middle age, members of N.W.A. no longer believe all of the hype. They\'re in an introspective space, to the great benefit of this film.',positive
'It all adds up to a terrific, if biased on the side of the winners (Dre and Cube) history lesson, and a thoroughly compelling, very American and utterly modern musical biography.',positive
'The performances are terrific, and when it\'s on its game, which is often, Straight Outta Compton is an explosive look at the creation of a message that had to be delivered by the only people who could deliver it, a message that is, unfortunately, as timely now as when we first heard it.',positive
'Despite Straight Outta Compton\'s energetic acting and Gray\'s capture of in-studio Eureka! moments, it never manages to transcend biopic hagiography, with characters whose names appear in the production credits – Dre, Cube and Eazy-E\'s widow Tomica Woods-Wright – faring best onscreen.',positive
'If the movie pushes most of the ugliest behavior off onto side players (like the notorious Suge Knight, played by R. Marcus Taylor), it does for the most part fulfill its mission, breathing life into the origin story of a group whose influence is still being felt.',positive
'Straight Outta Compton, while often entertaining and dynamic, ultimately feels as if its meant to act as a kind of cinematic trophy to rest on a pedestal that celebrates not only N.W.A., but the successful and trailblazing members who helped define hip hop outside of the group.',positive
'It\'s biopic syndrome, this impulse to condense events to hit the high notes, to provide fans with recognizable stories, to essentially act as a greatest hits album, and it sinks the second half of an otherwise compelling, funny and extremely entertaining film with a beat all its own.',positive
'F. Gary Gray\'s Straight Outta Compton starts out strong, peaks quickly, and then gets tangled in complications and compromise and falls apart.',positive
'When the songs themselves take center stage the movie works. What remains in the wings constitutes another, fuller story.',positive
'If Compton is undeniably of the moment, it\'s also timeless in its depiction of how artists and writers transform the world around them into angry, profane, vibrant and singular personal expression.',positive
'It\'s most towering accomplishment are its set pieces, which manage to be brash, exhilarating, and even occasionally moving.',positive
'Besides the movie\'s weight in our contemporary, post-Ferguson historical moment, Straight Outta Compton may also be the funniest, most exhilarating and flat-out best Hollywood movie of the summer.',positive
'Straight Outta Compton plays better when it\'s outside the box, showing us N.W.A power and the consequences of abusing it. Would the movie be better if it didn\'t sidestep the band\'s misogyny, gay-bashing and malicious infighting? No shit. But what stands is an amazement, an electrifying piece of hip-hop history that speaks urgently to right now.',positive
'Credit goes to smart casting of unknowns in the leads, who click uniformly; a packed script that manages not to feel overly long and social commentary that is timeless.',positive
'One of the summer\'s most entertaining and provocative movies.',positive
'This is one of the better musical biopics of the last 20 years.',positive
'More interesting than the hows and whys of N.W.A.\'s controversial rise and fall in the industry are the inside snapshots of the industry itself, from grimy Compton clubs to electrifying arena concerts to hotel orgies to studio sessions that illuminate Dr. Dre\'s creative process.',positive
'The heroine\'s voice-overs, delivered into the microphone of a Bell & Howell tape recorder in Minnie\'s bedroom, are the movie\'s motor. They\'re proud and insecure, profanely comic, dripping with adolescent wisdom and self-absorption.',positive
'Marielle Heller\'s debut directorial effort is incisive and universal, despite its very specific and detailed setting.',positive
'As told through Heller\'s acutely sensitive vision, the result is less off-putting and more of an authentic insight into a perspective grossly underrepresented in American cinema.',positive
'The result – believable, hopeful, tender, delightful – is a movie of (increasingly rare) truly indie sensibility, made by women who are confident about healthy feminine resilience.',positive
'[Wiig\'s] great, but the film\'s in the pocket of Powley\'s rib-high corduroys from the second she struts onscreen — and long after she takes them off.',positive
'A remarkably vibrant and frank look at one precocious teen\'s emerging sexual life — a film with the stuff of life coursing through its veins and sex very much on its brain.',positive
'The Diary of a Teenage Girl is the rare movie that presents the subject of the loss of virginity from the female perspective. Not only is the film unique in this regard, but also in its frankness, humor, and artistry.',positive
'An honest and personal and unblurred examination (even through that druggy blur) of a tricky voyage into womanhood.',positive
'Films often fail to capture the turmoil of being a teenager — but not this one.',positive
'That it\'s unsettling not just because of the contentious moral context underlines just how radical any realistic depictions of female desire and sexual experience still are.',positive
'The result is a film that is funny and sad, scary and sweet, disturbing and revelatory.',positive
'Powley is sensational, expertly blending hilarity and heartbreak. Her scenes with Wiig, sublime in her hard-won gravity, are unique and unforgettable. Just like the movie.',positive
'One needn\'t have first-person experience with, or even approve of, the extremes Minnie pursues to appreciate the honest, forthright way Heller and Powley present a journey that, stripped to its most basic emotional elements, is timeless and universal.',positive
'True to its title, Marielle Heller\'s adaptation of Phoebe Gloeckner\'s semi-autobiographical novel has the loosely structured, unfiltered feel of a young person\'s diary.',positive
'What it doesn\'t do -- and this is what makes this Diary different -- is let what happens define her or ruin her.',positive
'The movie\'s dedication to girls everywhere is unnecessary; it already feels so specific and true without it.',positive
'As uneven as it can be at times in its last fifteen minutes, Marielle Heller has crafted a super promising debut that evokes the idea of unlocking the secret world of teenage girls and letting us live inside the special little jewel box if ever so briefly.',positive
'The first thing to know about The Diary of a Teenage Girl is that young British actress Powley is staggeringly good in it.',positive
'Young women have desires too, and the unsinkable, uninhibited Minnie finds that a little self-belief can make up for a lot of bad decisions.',positive
'Busy British newcomer Bel Powley is extraordinary as the teen finding her identity in mid-1970s San Francisco.',positive
'Minnie\'s inner life, a fantasia of animations appearing Crumb-like around her, is dazzling, and there\'s plenty of naked emotion amid the sex, drugs and hand-drawn penises.',positive
'What a ballsy film and honest too.',positive
'This adaptation of Phoebe Gloeckner\'s heavily autobiographical novel is ideally cast and skillfully handled.',positive
'Movies concerned with the life, the mind, the body and the dawning self-respect of a 15-year-old girl running every sort of risk — these are rare. The Diary of a Teenage Girl is one of them, and it\'s terrific.',positive
'You don\'t often hear the adjective uncomfortable used as a compliment. But you\'re seldom going to come across a movie that makes you as uncomfortable as The Diary of a Teenage Girl yet seems as true to life.',positive
'It is not a pleasure to sit through, not even remotely, not even by some stretched definition of the word pleasure. It\'s work, but it\'s ultimately rewarding work. It tackles some truths that other movies wouldn\'t touch, not even with a stick and thick gloves.',positive
'Debut director Marielle Heller\'s spent a lot of time with this material — she wrote and starred in an off-Broadway adaptation — and her confident direction of Powley, Skarsgård and Wiig, fused with a Polaroid-evocative palette and a glam \'70s soundtrack, makes this an indelible coming-of-age story.',positive
'The sex is explicit and frequent and pretty much covers the spectrum. The drug use that accompanies it cringe-worthy. No man could have ever gotten away with adapting Phoebe Gloeckner\'s novel in such frank terms.',positive
'A rare gem of a movie.',positive
'The novel is life-specific, but what makes Minnie — on the page and now on the screen — greater than any one girl is how she tells her own story in her own soaringly alive voice.',positive
'It\'s this adoption not only of Minnie\'s point of view but the voice and narrative style of her half girlish, half womanly outlook on life that makes The Diary of a Teenage Girl such a vibrant, hopeful film.',positive
'It\'s morally complex and sometimes uncomfortably close to the bone, but also lushly bawdy and funny, and packaged together with an astonishing degree of cinematic brio by first-time writer-director Marielle Heller.',positive
'As unsettling as Marielle Heller\'s feature-film debut can be — there are moments you\'ll ache for Minnie and other ones where you\'ll want to lock her away — it rings much truer than most coming-of-age stories.',positive
'For all of Heller\'s impressive direction, she could have delivered something soulless without Powley\'s contributions.',positive
'The Green Inferno is not exactly a feel-good film, but it gets a very particular job done.',positive
'Unlike the \'70s Italian cannibal movies, The Green Inferno doesn\'t have a mondo vibe. It\'s artfully made and acted with skill.',positive
'With some genuinely insightful dialogue, a number of truly funny bits of physical business, and small scenes allowing us to get know and like a half-dozen supporting players, The Intern grows us on from scene to scene, from moment to moment.',positive
'There\'d be a lot less strife and starvation, disease and dread, if Nancy Meyers ruled the world.',positive
'It\'s not much of a movie. But raging bull Robert De Niro, suited up to play for humor and heart, proves he can be a world-class charmer.',positive
'Has its bright spots but is practically blinded by its own privileged perspective of life among the landed gentry of Brooklyn.',positive
'The success of this film may ride entirely on the alchemy of these particular actors, but whatever is carrying it, The Intern gets there.',positive
'These days, it\'s tough to find a comedy that even aspires to sophistication. The Intern entertainingly fills that slot.',positive
'Here\'s the thing: The Intern, while having its share of silly moments, is the most genuinely enjoyable and likable movie that Meyers — a longtime writer and producer before taking up directing — has put her name to since, oh, I don\'t know, 1984\'s Irreconcilable Differences.',positive
'With The Intern, Meyers has made another bright, contemporary American comedy with a lot on its mind — and works hard to make it look effortless.',positive
'When the film gets more serious it produces some affecting moments between the two leads.',positive
'Playing a 70-year-old seeking renewed purpose as an intern at an Internet start-up, Robert De Niro is gentle as a kitten. Is it disrespectful to want to greet this icon of American cinema with a snuggle and a tumbler of warm milk?',positive
'Meyers wants this to be all sort of amiable and charming and a big warm bath of a film, and it is.',positive
'Hathaway\'s take on the underwritten Jules is refreshingly unshowy, but De Niro seems a little lost.',positive
'While most other films sprint through expository dialogue, and bluster their way through action scenes, The Last Witch Hunter is measured enough to make you want to suspend your disbelief.',positive
'The story works out like you might expect. The joys are in the way director Breck Eisner, like Diesel, is earnest about this goofiness. His direction might not showcase the full wit of the script, but it does honor its inventiveness.',positive
'It has enough ingredients for a reasonably entertaining fantasy adventure—except, that is, for an interesting lead character with an emotionally compelling hook.',positive
'If you have a fondness for the genre and a particular love of \'60s pop, The Man From UNCLE is the summer\'s big fizzy drink, all bubbles, and while it may be gone the moment you walk out of the theater, the smile it puts on your face will likely linger.',positive
'It succeeds admirably on its own terms – more so, I think, than his two Sherlock Holmes films – and while it never really transcends pastiche, its ambitions don\'t lie in that direction.',positive
'Though it\'s made with lots of modern tricks and technology, it\'s old-fashioned in the best sense, and not just because it\'s set in the Sixties.',positive
'It turns out to be absolutely delightful.',positive
'The spectacular Italian locations, jazzy score and vehicular action finally go somewhere in the third act, when Ritchie riffs a few stylistic conventions of the era. Mesmerizing and clever, but more style than substance.',positive
'A lot of energy and effort has gone into this endeavor, and I can\'t say some of it\'s not fun. But more of it, alas, is just tedious. Say uncle already.',positive
'Vikander, the sexbot in Ex Machina, is having a hell of a year. And you can see why. Gaby isn\'t much of a part, but Vikander makes her a live wire. Her impromptu dance with Kuryakin that ends in a wrestling match is, well, something to see.',positive
'Temperamentally, Guy Ritchie aligns more with the lithe, James Bond-like Solo: detached, above-it-all, eternally cool under pressure.',positive
'U.N.C.L.E. has enough style and smarts to make it an amusingly louche summer movie: a cultivated mix of action and wit, suits and cities, that feels refreshingly analogue in a digital world.',positive
'This new Man from U.N.C.L.E. would be an instant masterpiece if it were consistently as good as its best parts, but even as a hit-and-miss affair, it\'s a bracing bit of late-summer fun for anyone who has given up the notion of a major studio offering anything truly revelatory until at least October.',positive
'A celebration of a time when secret agents dressed impeccably, bantered with style, and had exceptionally cool toys. That the movie is almost instantly forgettable is part of the pleasure.',positive
'Director Guy Ritchie, who wasn\'t born when the TV show debuted in 1964, cleverly captures the elements that made it a success.',positive
'It has taken Warner Brothers ten years to get this property a new life and, thankfully, the results in no way resemble those of its Cold War TV compatriot. Or, to put it another way, The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015) is good fun, which The Avengers (1998) wasn\'t.',positive
'What really sets The Man From U.N.C.L.E. apart is its refusal to pander to short attention spans. This is a movie whose charm sneaks up on you, like a spy in the night.',positive
'While The Man From U.N.C.L.E. probably isn\'t any less of a caricature of its period than Sherlock Holmes, it carries its fakeness with more snap in its step. The imaginary intrigue it generates is fleeting, but often beautiful.',positive
'The Man from U.N.C.L.E. plays a like a lower key, vintage edition of a Mission: Impossible movie. It\'s a good movie with a great look.',positive
'What\'s so fascinating about the film is that it truly turns on the solving of problems, and its chief solver, stuck on Mars, manages to be so funny, interesting and infallibly likable that you\'re invested in his predicament at every moment.',positive
'It takes a genuine master craftsman to take something as complex and difficult as this and make it look easy, but it also takes an artist with a great ear to take something as dense with exposition as this is and make it practically sing.',positive
'The supporting cast is an embarrassment of riches for Scott, and Chastain is particularly strong as the concerned commander of the mission. Yet this is most definitely Damon\'s movie and a throwback to the unabashed idealism of Hollywood past.',positive
'It\'s one of the most comforting science fiction films in years.',positive
'The Martian is a straightforward and thrilling survival-and-rescue adventure, without the metaphysical and emotional trappings of, say, Interstellar.\'\' It\'s pure fun.',positive
'The Martian really, truly works — not as art, necessarily, but as the sort of epic, intelligent entertainment the mainstream film industry has supposedly forgotten how to craft. All that, and the movie\'s a valentine to creative collaboration as well as an example of it. It\'s enough to make you almost grateful.',positive
'The Martian is never less than engaging, and often much more than that.',positive
'The Martian is nearly all things to all audiences: a ticking-clock drama, an intimate character study, a sci-fi comedy, a rollicking space adventure. It\'s almost impossible to dislike, which is perhaps its only flaw. When a huge film reveals its eager-to-please intentions from the get-go, the stakes evaporate awfully quick.',positive
'This is science fiction for sophisticated audiences and, as such, a fulfilling and satisfying experience.',positive
'What\'s being marketed as a sober, straightforward sci-fi drama (the words Bring him home superimposed on an unsmiling Matt Damon inside a space helmet) is instead a smart, exhilarating, often disarmingly funny return to classic adventures of yore.',positive
'The most fascinating thing about the film is how it leans into predictability rather than make a show of fighting it.',positive
'Damon is terrific. The movie lives and breathes on his performance, and he comes through in every scene.',positive
'Ridley Scott\'s The Martian is a brainy blockbuster, melding genuine science and fiction into a rare popcorn epic that actually makes you feel smarter for watching.',positive
'At its heart, The Martian is an unapologetically stirring celebration of our ability, as a species, to solve even the most daunting problems via rational thought, step by step by step. It\'s basically Human Ingenuity: The Movie.',positive
'Damon has never seemed more at home than he does here, millions of miles adrift.',positive
'[An] enormously entertaining movie.',positive
'Mr. Damon\'s Everyman quality (he\'s our Jimmy Stewart) helps scale the story down, but what makes this epic personal is Mr. Scott\'s filmmaking, in which every soaring aerial shot of the red planet is answered by the intimate landscape of a face.',positive
'The animating humanism of Scott\'s film is irreducible. It\'s a wry tribute to the qualities that got our species into space in the first place: our resourcefulness, our curiosity and our outsized, ridiculous, beautiful brains.',positive
'Bringing optimism, nerd-itude and a touch of crazy to his character\'s solo ordeal—at one point, scraggly Watney calls himself a space pirate—Damon is the key to the movie\'s exuberance.',positive
'Anchored by another great turn from Matt Damon, The Martian mixes smarts, laughs, weird character bits and tension on a huge canvas. The result is Scott\'s most purely enjoyable film for ages.',positive
'It\'s not iconic sci-fi to match Alien or Blade Runner but it is a topical, supremely crafted, intelligent, heartfelt spectacle with gallows humour to die for. Strap yourself in.',positive
'The director and screenwriter downplay the conventional melodrama inherent in the situation in favor of emphasizing how practical problems should be addressed with rational responses rather than hysteria, knee-jerk patriotism or selfish expedience.',positive
'While there are a few loose ends in Drew Goddard\'s screenplay, which is faithful to but necessarily less detailed than its source, the film is a triumph of storytelling, a tribute to the power of the crowd-pleaser.',positive
'Scott\'s sci-fi adventure is the kind of film you leave the theater itching to tell your friends to see. Like Apollo 13 and Gravity, it turns science and problem solving into an edge-of-your-seat experience.',positive
'Entertaining as the movie often is, this all-American, can-do attitude is also the source of its shortcomings. Given the enormousness of its subject, there is a radical lack of awe in this movie.',positive
'What makes The Martian work is Damon.',positive
'A gorgeous film that could inspire a whole new crop of astronauts.',positive
'Yes, The Martian does look like it was shot on Mars, even though the film\'s tone is suspiciously light and cheerful for Scott, who tends to thrive on a chillier, more dour habitat.',positive
'A lot of the information in The Martian will be incomprehensible to the lay audience and the climax is…well, not exactly original. But it makes for one hell of an entertaining ride.',positive
'The Martian celebrates both the indomitable human spirit and the belief that our species can, with patience and common sense, think its way out of almost any problem. If the film occasionally preaches, its message strikes home.',positive
'The coolest sequences in the film are its first third, with Watney\'s communication cut off and NASA unaware he\'s there.',positive
'As commercial entertainment, The Martian delivers on expectations of a smart blockbuster even as it adheres to the formula of a relatively simple feel-good drama. Though Interstellar aimed for more ambition, The Martian plays it safer: It\'s a brainy studio effort that sticks to familiar ground in more ways than one.',positive
'The Martian is the most purely enjoyable picture Scott has made in years. The streamlined narrative and the film\'s consistent pacing, aided by a cast who don\'t make a wrongfooted move, makes for easy popcorn entertainment.',positive
'Visually spectacular and consistently entertaining, Ridley Scott\'s space rescue procedural The Martian suffers only from a failure to hit its emotional beats with the amount of force and feeling usually required to make this kind of life-and-death adventure really take off.',positive
'The Martian is shot, designed, computer-generated, and scripted on a level that makes most films of its ilk look slipshod. Scott and writer Drew Goddard aren\'t trying to make an important sci-fi movie like Interstellar. They aim lower but blow past their marks.',positive
'You can argue that the plot of The Martian doesn\'t offer many surprises, but this is a movie of innumerable delightful moments and small discoveries, and even more of infectious enthusiasm.',positive
'The Martian is a film that respects the geekiest among us, and that pays off all around.',positive
'Perhaps most importantly, not only does the film stress the importance of using math and physics and botany and chemistry to solve problems, but it also makes a plot based on scientific inquiry and audacity just as exciting and even more unpredictable as the movies\' usual brand of problem-solving, the kind that involves punching everyone and then blowing everything up.',positive
'An enthralling and rigorously realistic outer-space survival story.',positive
'This suspenseful survival tale, smartass to its core, slaps a smile on your face that you\'ll wear all the way home.',positive
'In an age of digital chaos and deep emotional themes The Peanuts Movie keeps things sweet and simple, perfectly in tune with the qualities Schulz fans adore.',positive
'The Peanuts Movie may be simultaneously the most charming and the most daring experiment in human genetics ever conducted. At issue is whether the character summaries and back stories of fictional pop-culture figures can be passed from one generation to the next solely through DNA.',positive
'Peanuts is all about simplicity, and what the plot lacks in nuance and complexity is made up for with relatable characters whom people have spent a lifetime watching.',positive
'The efforts to stay true to the spirit of Schulz are worth a happy dance for kids and adults alike.',positive
'While it\'s more technically elaborate treatment than the characters have ever received, it\'s also gentler and more eye-pleasing than any of Blue Sky\'s other features. It‘s also a neat extension of Schulz\'s style—though, granted, no one needs to see Pig-Pen\'s permanent cloud of filth rendered more vividly.',positive
'Failure hovers over the film as much as it did in Schulz\'s comic strip, infusing even its most ebullient set pieces and designs with a sense of melancholy.',positive
'Lucy (Hadley Belle Miller) is still full of nickel-a-session psychotherapy, Linus still soulful enough to recognize his friend\'s heart. And Charlie\'s sister Sally (Mariel Sheets) still assumes Linus is her Sweet Baboo.',positive
'If The Peanuts Movie never quite reaches the melancholy of earlier films like A Boy Named Charlie Brown and Snoopy Come Home, it nonetheless respects the importance of failure and disappointment that Schulz always included in his storytelling.',positive
'Somehow, this Peanuts feels familiar, even cozy. I can\'t make any great claims for it, but it feels like the return of an old friend.',positive
'What\'s surprising — even wondrous — is how often Schulz\'s precisely crooked line work informs the big-budget gloss.',positive
'For those who know the strip well, The Peanuts Movie should feel like the first day of a new school year, reunited with a classroom full of familiar faces.',positive
'The comic strip\'s late creator Charles M. Schulz would undoubtedly approve of The Peanuts Movie, given his progeny have ensured the film remains true to his artistic and humanist vision.',positive
'This is a sweet, funny, smart, genuine all-ages movie with simple, timeless messages.',positive
'Frequently very funny, undeniably aimed at younger audiences, and true to the source material, The Peanuts Movie is too mild-mannered to win over brand new audiences, but it\'s going to please people who were already fond of the underlying property, and it should be a big nostalgia-driven hit for the studio.',positive
'A delightful romp that captures the spirit of the adored 65-year-old comic strip.',positive
'The film proves — in both style and attitude — a successful bridge between the old and the new, and one that, no matter its emotional slimness, ultimately never loses sight of the fretful angst with which all kids must, at some point, contend.',positive
'The voice work is on-target - the child actors, none of whom have played these parts before and many of whom have limited professional experience, nail their characters. They sound just like we expect them to sound.',positive
'Even with his glossy new look, Charlie Brown remains the Charlie Browniest.',positive
'The Peanuts Movie delivers genuine happiness with the door left open for woe.',positive
'An entertaining combination of humor and tenderness, The Peanuts Movie isn\'t just an all-ages crowd-pleaser. It\'s the perfect first feature film for a preschooler.',positive
'For all its third act nuttiness, The Perfect Guy really should have gone way crazier.',positive
'It uses convention to its advantage through an intriguing play with casting choices and bizarrely effective allusions to film history.',positive
'It\'s mindless entertainment with enough thrills and chuckles to make the time pass painlessly. Just don\'t examine anything too closely.',positive
'Refueled isn\'t a good movie by most metrics, but it is consistently committed to mainlining the basest action-movie pleasures at the expense of damn near everything else.',positive
'It\'s hard to deny the hedonistic joy in the way Delamarre plays with his various toys, and the goofball stunts—including the yacht-based finale, with a special appearance by a jet ski—are generally worth wandering through the dialogue desert.',positive
'A scary fun-house ride that expertly blends jittery tension and laugh-out-loud humor.',positive
'The Visit, M. Night Shyamalan\'s witty, crowd-jolting spook-house of an eleventh feature, is its writer-director\'s best movie since the tail-end of the last Clinton era. And it\'s the best studio horror flick in recent years, combining the but-what\'s-in-those-shadows? immersion of The Conjuring, James Wan\'s basement-wandering simulator, with the crack scripting and meta-cinematic surprises of Shyamalan\'s best early films.',positive
'The director M. Night Shyamalan has a fine eye and a nice, natural way with actors, and he has a talent for gently rap-rap-rapping on your nerves.',positive
'Refreshingly, this isn\'t so much a found-footage movie – although it was backed by Paranormal Activity overseers Blumhouse Productions – as it is a completed faux documentary, complete with onscreen titles and a cripplingly hilarious end-credits sequence featuring Tyler being Tyler.',positive
'Isn\'t the whole handheld real-video thing kind of old by now? Isn\'t the Shyamalanian-twist thing kind of old by now, too?',positive
'The low-budget thriller deftly mixes horror-movie moments, pure strangeness and comedy like a family-friendly David Lynch effort as it takes audiences on one really oddball trip to grandma\'s house.',positive
'The cast of mostly unfamiliar actors also serves The Visit well. Shyamalan has a gift for eliciting strong performances, even when his material is lacking.',positive
'No spoilers, except to say that cheap thrills can still be a blast. Not enough to make up for Shyamalan\'s awful After Earth, but it\'s a start.',positive
'When the trademark Shyamalan twist finally arrives, it doesn\'t synthesize anything other than the director\'s devotion to his signature gimmick.',positive
'A film so purely entertaining that you almost forget how scary it is. With all its terror, The Visit is an extremely funny film.',positive
'It may not be a complete return to form for the once-revered auteur, but as an unexpectedly chilling horror concoction defined by skillful scares, it\'s a significant step in the right direction.',positive
'It\'s vintage Shyamalan, with a twist.',positive
'It\'s a genuinely fun affair – let\'s not write it off as a cult classic just yet – with the smirking air of a confidant and mischievous filmmaker.',positive
'This is the first Shyamalan movie in a long time that viewers may be tempted to re-visit just to see how he pulls off his magic trick.',positive
'Like the film itself, it\'s simple but well-executed enough.',positive
'A refreshing (and memorably strange) genre piece, premised almost entirely on a child\'s willingness to accept grown-up weirdness as long as it ensures stability.',positive
'M. Night Shyamalan has come up with an unoriginal faux-doc horror picture that actually works like a demonic charm.',positive
'The Walk is a visionary high-wire act.',positive
'Working from a script co-written with Christopher Browne, director Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump) pulls off a fabulous trick of his own: delivering a mainstream entertainment that has, at its heart, a poetic sensibility.',positive
'Ignore the tell and focus on the show, spectacular in every sense.',positive
'After two hours of The Walk, I felt as if I\'d walked the wire myself. I was agitated and exhausted. During the movie, I was squirming and wincing, and a few times even had to close my eyes, just to find some relief.',positive
'A narrative feature can do what the documentary couldn\'t: re-create the tightrope act in full, glorious motion, rather than editing together surreptitiously snapped photos. These dizzying IMAX 3-D visuals truly are big-screen magic.',positive
'This is a love letter to lunacy (and an unspoken tribute to the iconic towers) that lets you feel what it\'s like to tread where only gods dare.',positive
'It\'s when the walk portion of The Walk arrives that this unevenly scripted, fact-based thriller achieves its full potential. Even without the suspense of uncertainty, the sequence achieves a bated-breath intensity and wonder.',positive
'A marvelous technical achievement when the director finally gets around to it.',positive
'As breathtakingly gorgeous and well acted as The Walk is, if you had to choose between the doc and this solid fictionalized version, I\'d say go with the documentary.',positive
'The rare movie that improves as it goes along, shedding its cliches and getting down to what matters.',positive
'The Walk is the movie that takes us up there, gives us the jitters and makes us titter along the way.',positive
'In the end, The Walk finds a graceful way to pay tribute not only to Petit\'s bravery and determination — but to the thousands lost on 9/11 in the buildings this daredevil loved so much.',positive
'Zemeckis turns the event into a kind of blockbuster Cinéma Pur – an almost avant-garde game of composition, movement and perspective, exhilaratingly attuned to form and space. (Mad Max: Fury Road did the same.) The camerawork is subtle and meticulous, the 3D head-spinningly well-applied.',positive
'In order to make the walk, and in order for it to matter to him, Philippe Petit has to comprehend it as real and impossible. Zemeckis teaches us the same lesson.',positive
'The Walk is broadly written with two clunky first acts that are saved, arguably superseded entirely, by its nerve-wracking, majestic and spectacular finish.',positive
'The problem — not fatal — with The Walk is that the narrative wire droops between the movie\'s opening and final sequences.',positive
'It would be swell if all of The Walk came together as beautifully as the computer effects do, but it would also be churlish not to appreciate what we do have. This film may not talk the talk, but it definitely walks the walk, and for that we are grateful.',positive
'Zemeckis is a master of using effects, but his films sometimes don\'t live up to them.... The Walk is different. The use of 3D, in particular, is so astonishing it practically wipes your memory of the silliness going on in France as Petit was learning his trade. Once Petit is on the wire, he is free, and the liberation is contagious.',positive
'The Walk, in its last half at least, is a dazzling piece of work, particularly in 3-D; even so, its most luminous effect is an actor.',positive
'Harnessing the wizardry of 3-D IMAX to magnify the sheer transporting wonder, the you-are-there thrill of the experience, the film\'s payoff more than compensates for a lumbering setup, laden with cloying voiceover narration and strained whimsy.',positive
'I wish the film had done more – anything – to analyze Petit\'s psyche. But he barely exists in the movie except as a certified daredevil.',positive
'By now, we\'ve grown accustomed to the signature touch of Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump), who is one of the best creative minds to see the innovative narrative potential lying dormant in technical cinematographic advances. This does not always provide the underpinnings for great stories, but bien sûr his movies are almost always quite something to see.',positive
'This is ultimately a frustrating work. The Walk has everything it needs to be a modern classic, except for an understanding that when you have everything you need to make such a film, it doesn\'t need to hype itself and explain itself. It can just be.',positive
'The 17-minute wire-walking sequence is the most majestic simulation of a real event since the ship sinking in Titanic—a dazzling triumph of photorealistic digital effects, which exhibits Zemeckis\' mastery of both CGI and pace.',positive
'The Walk satisfies as an absorbing yarn of authority-flouting ad­ven­ture and as an example of stomach-flipping you-are-there-ness. The journey it offers viewers doesn\'t just span 140 feet, but also an ethereal, now-vanished, world.',positive
'For those who want to feel like they\'re 110 stories up and living in the clouds, Hollywood does its job conjuring movie magic with a breathtaking Walk to remember.',positive
'I cannot say how I\'d feel about The Walk if I\'d never seen Man on Wire, because I did see Man on Wire, and I can\'t un-see it. I love it. I can only say The Walk struck me as an honorable good try of an also-ran, though with some lovely things to offer.',positive
'What Zemeckis delivers here is an entirely different brand of spectacle from that which audiences have come to expect from recent studio tentpoles, sharing a true story so incredible it literally must be seen to be believed, as opposed to imaginary feats full of impossible CG creatures.',positive
'Almost magically, The Walk transforms itself into a beguiling caper movie, full of comic energy and nimble ingenuity.',positive
'When you\'re watching something Zemeckis made, anything can happen, and reality is up for grabs. In this case, he\'s used his powers for good, and the end result is stirring and spectacular at times, with a devastating, if subtle, final line of dialogue.',positive
'Zemeckis reminds us that it\'s in the service of reality, rather than fantasy, that digital technology is often most potent.',positive
'As a celebration of agility, ability, and outlandish human behavior, The Walk is a winning thing. It may not get inside the head of its pole-balancing protagonist - it doesn\'t really even try - but Zemeckis\' movie takes you skyward.',positive
'For those who buy into the precept that good things are worth waiting for, The Walk unquestionably delivers.',positive
'Mr. Redford doesn\'t look like Dan Rather, but displays the same dedication to — and respect for — journalism that he brought to the role of Bob Woodward in All the President\'s Men.',positive
'Blanchett gives this dynamo of intelligence and doggedness a real human dimension that allows the propulsive drama to breathe; it\'s another stellar performance that rates among her best.',positive
'We see the mistakes before the principals do. That\'s what makes the news-story-gone-wrong drama Truth so compelling.',positive
'Truth would have been more compelling with less sanctimony and tougher self-examination.',positive
'Truth is a journalism horror story, something like All the President\'s Men but with the wrong ending and plenty of blame on all sides. It is one of the most frustrating speak-truth-to-power tales ever put onscreen, because it dares to show how that usually works out: Power wins. Big.',positive
'The film basically upholds the verity of the news story while not condoning the sloppiness, and it\'s worth seeing mostly for Cate Blanchett\'s firebrand performance as Mapes, a battler consumed by righteousness.',positive
'It\'s not surprising that Truth takes the perspective that it does — you don\'t cast Cate Blanchett and Robert Redford as Mapes and Rather and not expect the film to side with them.',positive
'Blanchett burns on a high flame, and Redford finds the wounded dignity in Rather.',positive
'Blanchett, a commanding figure who scowls her way through every argument, gives Mapes an involving screen presence that elaborates on the character\'s staunch resolve much better than the straightforward script.',positive
'The weirdness of Truth — and, I fear, its involuntary comic value — arises from a disparity between the sparse and finicky minutiae of the narrative and the somewhat bouffant style of the presentation.',positive
'Truth is a movie curiously in conflict with itself. There is a constant shift between granular detail and big-picture sweep that the movie never fully resolves.',positive
'Vanderbilt, the screenwriter of Zodiac, here making his debut as a director, masters the heady pulse of high-end, high-stakes journalism.',positive
'To say Blanchett is good here is a grave understatement.',positive
'Writer/director James Vanderbilt...sticks to Mapes\' version of the truth, and the film serves as a valedictory for Mapes and Rather. Still, the movie never negates the truth\'s other strands, while also showing what a human profession journalism is.',positive
'Engrossing and occasionally moving, it doesn\'t electrify like that other film about the press taking on a chief executive, Alan Pakula\'s All the President\'s Men (1976).',positive
'It can\'t develop themes because it\'s too busy disseminating information, and this extends to its main characters.',positive
'Truth also ignores Rather\'s famous showboating, pettiness and hubris. He\'s worked in lower-profile gigs since, but trust me, there\'s a good reason why no news organization will touch Mapes with a 10-foot pole.',positive
'Debuting director James Vanderbilt (who wrote Zodiac) has a great sense of forward motion and wrings suspense from an idea-driven story.',positive
'The most engrossing part of Truth is the gradual, grueling retreat from the story, first by its participants and then by the network that broadcast it.',positive
'More than most docudramas about fairly recent events, it is so well written and acted that it conveys a convincing illusion of veracity.',positive
'Blanchett makes us feel the creeping horror of professional disgrace, the fear and stigma, however unfair Mapes argues her treatment may have been. We watch a polished professional come apart at the seams, caught up in self-incrimination and spiralling neurosis.',positive
'In the closing act, the film sharpens and becomes something far more compelling.',positive
'The keenly focused intelligence and low-boil intensity that James Vanderbilt demonstrated in his screenplay for Zodiac are on impressive display in Truth.',positive
'Truth is a strange interpretation of events, in which the visuals and the music sometime seem to be nudging us in one direction, even as the screenplay and the performances are telling us something quite different.',positive
'Impressively designed throughout, The Unbeatables also keeps the laughs kicking.',positive
'War Room is a gold-plated piece of Bible thumping that\'s resonating with the same audience that watches Jimmy Stewart get touched by an angel every December in It\'s a Wonderful Life — and cry next to Christmas trees, despite that film\'s many hackneyed religious devices.',positive
'[An] enormously fun late-summer surprise.',positive
'A study in intoxicants: drink, drugs, youth and Emily Ratajkowski. All four are potentially dangerous, yet nearly impossible to leave alone.',positive
'It\'s all big, dumb, broad strokes, with plot points visible from miles away. But it works where it matters: The music is fantastic, and the film invests you in its central relationship.',positive
'We Are Your Friends is predictable, sometimes tacky, but the energy is unflagging, the eye candy plentiful and writer-director Max Joseph (making his feature debut after hosting MTV\'s Catfish) brings sincerity and a skillfully modulated sweetness to the material.',positive
'What makes We Are worth your time is Joseph\'s skill in conveying the euphoria of dance music in the context of an actual movie.',positive
'The musical sequences throb with energy and this allows We Are Your Friends to maintain its trajectory when its momentum flags.',positive
'If you suspend your disbelief for some of the weaker plot points and unnecessary use of the c-word, the film is palatable.',positive
'Joseph\'s direction offers up an energetic take on the material, incorporating text visualization, quick-cutting montages, and creative uses of animation to bring the thumping electronic music to cinematic life.',positive
'As Zac Efront\'s Cole tiptoes away from his past, the film keenly observes a character who doesn\'t know how to secure his future, or his identity.',positive
'The film largely succeeds in achieving its modest goals, delivering a feel-good, real-life inspirational story in a mostly engaging fashion.',positive
'Christensen underplays throughout 90 Minutes in Heaven, even in scenes when Piper isn\'t operating under the influence of painkillers, and his earnestness often comes off as monotonous. Still, he generates interest and sympathy, almost in spite of himself, and Bosworth lends capable support as a loyal spouse.',mixed
'The Christian faith-based film genre takes a dramatic leap forward with 90 Minutes in Heaven, a well-appointed work based on Don Piper\'s bestseller, that, for a change, doesn\'t look and sound as though it was written, performed, and recorded in some church basement.',mixed
'90 Minutes is one of the better faith-based films out there.',mixed
'While Nourizadeh\'s just-for-fun head trip is no more ambitious than its long-haired pothead of a main character, it delivers on its sole goal: to entertain and to surprise.',mixed
'Part stoner comedy, midnight movie, outsiders\' love story and ultraviolent B-movie, this intriguing film is given real soul by stars Jesse Eisenberg and Kristen Stewart, even if director Nima Nourizadeh\'s ambitions end up being more laudable than the results.',mixed
'The bone-crunching action and relentlessly blood-letting feels out of place, and as those sequences start appearing with more frequency, the film loses much of its rangy charm.',mixed
'American Ultra is undemanding late-summer studio fare — ultraforgettable. But I\'ll remember the faces of Eisenberg and Stewart, who are easy to ridicule but, whatever the pundits say, very much movie stars.',mixed
'The movie is replete with bloody encounters, sly asides, and one-liners, but the tone is awkward and uneven. There are also some serious structural problems that we\'re supposed to brush aside.',mixed
'American Ultra has a clever premise. But it misses several opportunities to at least comment on, if not skewer, the spy movies that it only halfheartedly pokes fun at. As it is, it\'s content to generate a low-grade buzz, rather than deliver a true high.',mixed
'What begins as a clever action-comedy a la Pineapple Express or Eisenberg\'s earlier Zombieland devolves into a standard shoot-\'em-up, with gore splashed around to distract us from the dearth of wit.',mixed
'If the filmmakers had opted to play things closer to the vest, this could have been the clever Pineapple Express-meets-The Bourne Identity mashup it wants to be instead of the shallow, gratuitously violent exercise it actually is.',mixed
'Eisenberg and Stewart stay appealing to the last. The movie, not so much.',mixed
'American Ultra is a clumsy mix of courtship and gunpowder, passion and horror leading to a romantically sick-humored conclusion. The end nearly justifies director Nima Nourizadeh\'s means of getting there. But not quite.',mixed
'Too often plays like an earnest yet unsatisfying adaptation of a cult graphic novel, with most of the charm lost in translation.',mixed
'A genre mash that\'s mildly amusing until it can\'t think of anything else to do besides flop around in the deep end of conspicuous gore.',mixed
'The action set-pieces and the comedic character scenes in the film seem to be taking turns and are rarely brought together in a meaningful way.',mixed
'A mere clever conceit isn\'t enough, and here, the action smells stale and the humor staler. There\'s no explosion we haven\'t seen before, no quip that feels fresh and new. I suggest you save American Ultra to stream on a lazy snow day this winter — even then, the deep sleeper who needs to be awoken might be you.',mixed
'This stoners-meet-government-assassins mashup is as meandering and paranoid as a guy toking up in front of City Hall. Sometimes that\'s amusing, but most of the time it\'s tiring.',mixed
'By turns sweet, sadistic, and silly, American Ultra will probably make a stronger impression if you watch it while high.',mixed
'Unfortunately both Eisenberg and Stewart, both frequently brilliant, are on unsure footing here. The movie simply doesn\'t know if it wants to be Jason Bourne or Cheech and Chong.',mixed
'Artless and unpleasant, this is the kind of late-summer swill that gives August a bad name.',mixed
'Nourizadeh and Landis are clearly going for a Tarantino level of blood-soaked dark humor, and while their cast is game, the film\'s bursts of violence grow tiresome as its plot gets more and more ludicrous and hard to swallow.',mixed
'If you go, expect a diverting summer action adventure with occasional laughs, not a diverting stoner comedy with occasional action.',mixed
'This slight, lightly charming comic adventure is most obviously appealing for the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel set — though Bryson himself was in his forties when he made his journey.',mixed
'Natural perfectly describes Nolte\'s performance, too. With his growly voice and bear-like aura, he might be dismissed as a walking sight gag, but don\'t let that fool you. Nolte\'s way with a joke is nimble, and his delivery is spot-on.',mixed
'A Walk in the Woods is certainly no Butch Cassidy, but it is interesting to check in with these two still-compelling codgers.',mixed
'It is unexpectedly moving and occasionally delightful to spend time with these titans of cinema as they walk and sometimes wobble, delivering words that become meaningful because they\'re lucky enough to be spoken by Mr. Redford and Mr. Nolte.',mixed
'It\'s pleasant enough cinematic comfort food, but even so, you may be hungry again soon afterward.',mixed
'The lax, lame A Walk in the Woods is a road movie without a road, a journey of self-discovery without discovery, and a tale of friendship without any chemistry.',mixed
'The nature of this fantasy is boringly feel-good and aspirational.',mixed
'Too much of the breezy humor that made the book a delight is stripped away, replaced with predictable jokes and broad slapstick, sitcom-quality encounters with women and bears and a pushy, grating sentimentality.',mixed
'It\'s not a difficult picture to watch. All you want from A Walk in the Woods, honestly, is a chance to enjoy a couple of veteran actors. But the book\'s comic tone hasn\'t found a comfortable equivalent for the screen.',mixed
'So this film feels less like an easy paycheck and more like semi-retirement. Whatever wisdom is coming out of Redford\'s mouth as Bryson, it always seems 100 percent clear he pursued the role because the shoot would be beautiful and he could pal around with an old friend.',mixed
'It has its charming, lively moments, but also many that just feel tired and listless, as if the filmmakers were working off a checklist of all the things two well-past-middle-age travelers would say and do while trekking through the wilderness.',mixed
'A Walk in the Woods is broad as a barn door, with two stars who have minimal chemistry — and there\'s not much in the way of reflection about mortality.',mixed
'For a moment, the movie tries to be about something deeper — some existential epiphany, perhaps. The book didn\'t deal in platitudes. It was content to be lightly educational, but mostly just entertaining. The movie aspires to be more than that, only to reveal how much less than that it really is.',mixed
'A Walk in the Woods is a trifle compared to 2014\'s Wild, which tracked a similar real-life journey toward self-discovery in richer detail. But darned if Redford\'s easy charm and Nolte\'s gravelly lack of it aren\'t enticing throughout.',mixed
'A middling sitcom.',mixed
'Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau never made a movie called Grumpy Old Men Go Camping. If they had, it surely would look a lot like A Walk in the Woods.',mixed
'One wouldn\'t expect A Walk In The Woods to be a rat-a-tat-tat 1930s comedy, but between the stars\' rusty comic timing and the script\'s stale setups, the movie simply isn\'t that funny, more likely to produce a smile than even a chuckle.',mixed
'Ultimately superficial yet watchable throughout, it\'s the very definition of classy fluff.',mixed
'If you think man-crack is the apex of hilarity, A Walk in the Woods just might be the movie for you. It\'s all right there in the trailers: slapstick, womp-womp one-liners, the premise of old buddies going on an adventure.',mixed
'The movie is often absorbing, and skillfully played, but, along with its snarling hero, it doesn\'t have much time for ordinary folk. By the end, like Marianne, we are left gasping for air.',mixed
'The movie itself is an intriguing but ultimately unspecial Feds-vs.-hoods drama. But as the sinister, snakelike South Boston criminal Whitey Bulger, Depp delivers.',mixed
'Black Mass is ultimately a decent film with some great parts, but unfortunately it falls short of the canon to which it aspires.',mixed
'It\'s hard to shake the suspicion that Depp is playing a type – almost as if he\'s trying to replicate the kind of performance Nicholson might have given in the same role. You long for him to roll his sleeves up and grasp the character\'s shape and soul himself, ideally without the aid of those distracting prosthetics.',mixed
'It\'s Bulger whose grim appearance and even grimmer behaviour ‘Black Mass\' indulges. But it\'s the quieter, more complicated Connolly who offers the film\'s subtler pleasures.',mixed
'Johnny Depp makes a valiant stab at the part, but even with his hair thinned and lightened and his face hardened, Depp remains Depp: I never forgot I was watching a big star doing an impersonation. It\'s as if the spirit of a psychopath like Bulger resists the camera. Or maybe the movie isn\'t imaginative enough to penetrate his shell.',mixed
'By all accounts, Boston mobster James Whitey Bulger was a monster. That\'s exactly how Johnny Depp plays him in Black Mass, a dark blob of underworld cliches and bad contact lenses.',mixed
'Even filmmakers and actors as fine as these haven\'t managed to solve one of cinema\'s most enduring challenges — making criminals interesting without exalting them.',mixed
'Depp isn\'t doing anything different here than he did in Dark Shadows or Alice in Wonderland or the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Once again, he\'s unrecognizable under elaborate makeup and prosthetics, and he speaks with a peculiar voice (this time a thick South Boston accent).',mixed
'Mr. Cooper\'s direction is skillful, if overly reliant on borrowed Scorseseisms (especially when it comes to music), and the cast is first-rate, but the film is a muddle of secondhand attitudes and half-baked ideas. It feels more like a costume party than a costume drama.',mixed
'Like any crime saga without a more potent thematic hook, the film\'s relentlessly insular script dwells on themes of loyalty and fraternity.',mixed
'Bridge of Spies, with its stop-and-go momentum, is also more merely interesting than it is full-on riveting. It\'s still quite good stuff, but despite its impressive pedigree... it doesn\'t feel as if it\'s quite the sum of all of its parts.',mixed
'Cooper swaggers as convincingly as always, the food-prep montages are mesmerizing, and we even get a couple of solid twists and an education on the sous-vide trend.',mixed
'Director John Wells dices the action, even the simplest conversation, into five harried shots when one would suffice. The many food-prep montages are cut and paced to the same numbing rhythm.',mixed
'As an often cliché-riddled tale of redemption on the big screen, Burnt is the equivalent of a sleek, well-lit, trendy restaurant serving up a mildly creative dishes on an otherwise predictable menu.',mixed
'The food, it must be said, is beautiful. (Mario Batali and Marcus Wareing were consultants on the film.) And Cooper, despite the shortcomings of the role as written, goes all in. So does Miller. This should be a better movie than it is.',mixed
'There\'s never any doubt that redemption is the end-game for Jones, but the claim for his saving is weak sauce; the case against him has been too emphatically, if unintentionally, argued.',mixed
'Burnt isn\'t a bad movie, but the melodrama is overwrought and overdone, the romance warmed over and the Cocktail formula shaken, stirred and utterly played.',mixed
'The film\'s haphazard construction is made all the more frustrating because somewhere in this material is a much more resonant picture.',mixed
'Cooper can do this kind of arrogant-but-irresistible golden boy shtick in his sleep, but that doesn\'t make it any less pleasurable to watch. Flashing his baby blues and a fiery temper, the actor gives a fully engaged performance that almost makes us want to forgive the movie\'s laziness. Almost.',mixed
'Every thoughtful story beat and every well-observed character moment happens with such predictability and slick professionalism that the whole project seems smothered in bland sweetness.',mixed
'Burnt deals less with the food itself than the way it drives Adam to the brink of insanity. Yet it falls short of generating any real urgency surrounding that situation.',mixed
'A tasteless concoction - one gay character is particularly misjudged - that\'s instantly forgettable.',mixed
'The movie gets duller and less focused as it wears on.',mixed
'Although John Wells\' dramedy is energized by its mouth-watering montages and an unsurprisingly fierce lead turn from Cooper, Steven Knight\'s script pours on the acid but holds the depth, forcing its fine actors (including Sienna Miller and Daniel Bruhl) to function less as an ensemble than as a motley sort of intervention group.',mixed
'An imperfectly executed but still perfectly enjoyable film.',mixed
'Cooper\'s charm, imposing post-American Sniper physique, and proficient French carry the movie, propped up by a very strong supporting cast... whose roles mostly consist of fascinated or exasperated reaction shots. It just doesn\'t carry the movie anywhere interesting.',mixed
'Just when you think you know where Burnt is headed, there\'s an underhanded twist about halfway in. And it\'s almost enough to set the movie right.',mixed
'Since John Wells is a director of some conscience and screenwriter Steven Knight is in fact capable of first-rate work, Burnt packs some minor surprises and attractive details along its way.',mixed
'The real issue is that everything about Adam\'s journey feels half digested and tossed back up. We\'ve seen it before. It was better the first time.',mixed
'What follows is a decently structured story of personal demons and culinary competition, with a couple of nice twists thrown in, but it\'s built with materials that at this point in the life cycle of this genre are mighty shopworn.',mixed
'Burnt is mildly diverting.',mixed
'Oyelowo and Mara try to bring humanity and tension to the testimonial thriller of two lost souls finding their way together, but they only succeed in bursts, hampered by marketing copy masquerading as dialogue.',mixed
'Although Captive largely succeeds as a two-hander, it stumbles in the minimal attempts to broaden the scope beyond Smith and Nichols\' time together.',mixed
'Though much of the drama is clunky and flat, the taut, visceral performances by David Oyelowo and Kate Mara never err.',mixed
'Convincing performances from David Oyelowo and Kate Mara – as an escaped killer and his drug addicted hostage – are the saving grace of Captive, a decent dramatic thriller somewhat weighed down by its mildly religious message.',mixed
'For a film supposedly about the transformative power of faith, Captive has very little to preach in that regard, apart from the importance of purchasing megachurch pastor Rick Warren\'s hit book, The Purpose Driven Life.',mixed
'Whatever power this piece of writing had over the two of them, Captive fails to capture the magic, hope or whatever made it a best seller.',mixed
'The leads acquit themselves relatively well here, hinting at the interesting character study that could have been, but by the end the only captive left is the viewer.',mixed
'The actors are committed – Mara, generally waif-like, appears frail indeed – but there\'s barely anything worth committing to.',mixed
'A credit-sequence television clip of Mr. Warren and the real Ms. Smith with Oprah Winfrey makes the entire movie feel like the strangest book infomercial in memory.',mixed
'A curious hybrid of grim fairytale and gory horror, del Toro\'s ninth feature is striking but sorely lacking in surprises. Great ghosts, but del Toro is capable of so much more.',mixed
'Crimson Peak is locked in by a somnambulist, formulaic vibe and comes off as contented to go through Gothic 101 motions without recourse to reinvention or refreshing vigour.',mixed
'The film is too busy, and in some ways too gross, to sustain an effective atmosphere of dread. It tumbles into pastiche just when it should be swooning and sighing with earnest emotion.',mixed
'Crimson Peak\'s astonishing visuals don\'t enhance its story (co-written by the director and Matthew Robbins); they overwhelm it, encouraging us to stand back and admire the look when we should be involved in the emotional mechanics of this lurid tale.',mixed
'All three actors work hard... and when the melodrama hits fever pitch, Crimson Peak lurches into life. But overall this lacks weight and intensity: a Brontë-esque bauble smeared in twenty-first-century slickness.',mixed
'The gifted fantasy/sci-fi/horror specialist has made a film that\'s very bloody, and bloody stylish at that, one that\'s certainly unequaled in its field for the beauty of its camerawork, sets, costumes and effects. But it\'s also conventionally plotted and not surprising or scary at all, as it resurrects hoary horror tropes from decades ago to utilize them in conventional, rather than fresh or subversive ways',mixed
'Crimson Peak ends up feeling like a bit of make-work, a project to keep the visionary filmmaker busy until something that truly sparks his passion comes along.',mixed
'Del Toro gets the ghostly elements right, with red and black flesh-torn spooks wailing warnings to the receptive Edith. But he goes wildly overboard in aiming for atmosphere after the story shifts to the Sharpes\' crumbling English manor.',mixed
'Crimson Peak is a gorgeous mediocrity.',mixed
'Not even the film\'s occasional bursts of ultra-violence, or the endlessly oozing red clay, or Hiddleston crying a red tear, or Chastain swanning around in one flaming crimson ball gown after another, can infuse this gorgeous bore with anything like red-blooded suspense.',mixed
'For sheer, sepulchral eye candy at this most horror-ific time of year, del Toro\'s Crimson Peak leaves Tim Burton – reigning misfit king of hyper-stylized, goth-y weirdness – in the dust and well-nigh forgotten.',mixed
'Aflame with color and awash in symbolism, this undeniably ravishing yet ultimately disappointing haunted-house meller is all surface and no substance, sinking under the weight of its own self-importance into the sanguine muck below.',mixed
'The insertion of attractive Hollywood stars into a daunting landscape makes for some odd contradictions of scale as the story unfolds with white-knuckle inevitability. [28 Sept. 2015, p.61]',mixed
'Though there is heroism as well as love here, because it involves the deaths of people we have come to care about, Everest is finally a sad story, though not always a dramatically involving one.',mixed
'Everest is a sprawling mess of a movie, one you feel like could have been great but instead roams all over the place and winds up being just pretty good.',mixed
'Everest is visually splendid, though it loses a few points for its murkiness in rendering its main characters as distinct individuals.',mixed
'A valiant effort that never quite scales the dizzy emotional heights required, running out of oxygen in the final act. Visually, though, it\'s stunning.',mixed
'Spectacular and well-acted, this suffers from much the same problem as the situation it depicts — too many people on the mountain and too many threads to follow so that affecting individual stories get lost in the snow.',mixed
'Ultimately, Everest is not concerned with the why, but with the how and it\'s grimly efficient at building up the drama, helped on by Clarke\'s wonderful character study, even if the film as a whole never quite reaches the dizzying heights of its subject.',mixed
'The hardship of the trek is vividly and stomach-lurchingly portrayed, particularly when the storm sets in, but it never makes the crucial leap from the screen into your bones.',mixed
'This is one of those cases where fictionalizing a true event, or at least fusing two or three real people into one composite character, might have resulted in tighter storytelling.',mixed
'Everest, in short, suffers from the same problem as Everest: overcrowding.',mixed
'The feature film Everest provides soaring visuals, but it\'s a distant second in terms of storytelling depth and narrative impact.',mixed
'Though it assembles a first-rate cast in a story taken from reality, Everest feels icebound and strangely abstract, lacking the gravity of genuine tragedy or the swagger of first-rate adventure.',mixed
'While it\'s impossible not to be somewhat caught up in these climbers\' life-or-death struggle, Everest is oddly uninvolving — it depicts a horrific scenario in an underwhelming, distancing way.',mixed
'Everest is a frustrating movie in many ways – despite some lurches and shocks, it doesn\'t quite deliver the edge-of-your-seat thrills that many were hoping for, and all those moderately engaging characters mean that there is no centrally powerful character.',mixed
'At first, it\'s fun and shiny, then you\'re left with a crumpled mess on the floor.',mixed
'It\'s shockingly humorless and glacially slow for a film featuring a bendy boy genius, an invisible woman, a human torch, and a talking pile of stones.',mixed
'With a weak structure and little chemistry, Fantastic Four proves itself to be a franchise that was better off lost in space.',mixed
'The impressive young cast -- is mostly wasted. Teller and company, despite their proven talents, are given little of depth to do and forced to spout dialog that ranges from clunky to ridiculous.',mixed
'The model here isn\'t adventure pulp. It\'s dystopian Y.A., junked up with scenes of medical horror too scary for kids and too unpleasant to be enjoyed by anyone.',mixed
'The film is almost all build-up, though any mounting sense of excitement is dispelled by the monotonously downbeat tone and the cast\'s conspicuous lack of chemistry. Nobody looks like they\'re having fun, and the gloom is infectious.',mixed
'As an origin story that\'s all origins and no story, there\'s a hollow, stale feeling to this occasionally admirable attempt to Nolanise Marvel\'s dysfunctional family.',mixed
'Ponderous, pretentious and, most damning of all, just not much fun.',mixed
'The cast are some of the most promising actors of their generation, but what chemistry there is between them is swept away by wave after wave of expository dialogue and ludicrous exclamation.',mixed
'This reboot of the Marvel superhero franchise is a film of two halves: the first likeable and fun, the second tiresome and loud.',mixed
'It\'s overstating things to say the stars of Fantastic Four are Miles Teller, Kate Mara, Michael B. Jordan, and Jamie Bell, because I can\'t remember the last time four actors appeared less invested in a movie for which they\'ve teamed up.',mixed
'Apparently Fantastic Four doesn\'t want to be another dumb superhero action flick, but try as they might to turn it into a movingly realistic drama, director Josh Trank and a pair of screenwriters never succeed, creating instead a comic book movie that is bizarrely short on humour and action.',mixed
'In short, this Josh Trank-directed reboot had a very low hurdle to overcome to become the best FF movie so far. The most fantastical aspect of the movie is that it may not achieve that goal.',mixed
'If Fantastic Four is pleasantly different in its introductory segment, once those super powers kick in, the whole film goes into a more standard gear.',mixed
'Is it a home run? No. But at this point, comic fans are just happy to see Fox play error-free ball with their Marvel adaptations, and Fantastic Four mostly qualifies.',mixed
'Neither the disaster the fanboy nation seems to be itching to attack nor a significant improvement over the Tim Story movies, Fantastic Four seems doomed to please no one.',mixed
'Ultimately, Fox\'s stab at reviving one of its inherited Marvel properties feels less like a blockbuster for this age of comics-oriented tentpoles than it does another also-ran — not an embarrassment, but an experiment that didn\'t gel.',mixed
'Director Josh Trank, whose debut feature Chronicle put a smart new spin on superhero tropes, has assembled a quartet of engaging, charismatic performers and stranded them in a miasma of exposition and set-up that sinks the movie.',mixed
'Goosebumps,Rob Letterman\'s film based on the R.L. Stine books (pretty much all of them), is silly, goofy, a little scary, a little poignant and a lot of fun.',mixed
'There\'s a streak of old-fashioned B-movie spooky playfulness here, and when actual, motivated characters are on screen it\'s delightful.',mixed
'Though it revives at least a dozen of Stine\'s most popular beasts and fiends, the new Goosebumps movie rarely recalls the old preteen page-turners for which it\'s named.',mixed
'It\'s occasionally funny and sometimes suspenseful, but it isn\'t particularly imaginative. Then again, neither are Stine\'s popular novellas.',mixed
'At a guess, I\'d say that Goosebumps will satisfy its core audience - fans of R.L. Stine\'s popular children\'s books - and bore pretty much everyone else.',mixed
'More often than not, Mr. Letterman uses his movie as a toy chest of characters more than as a medium, the muggy Mr. Black included.',mixed
'Although the film\'s content falls squarely within the PG rating, it provides about 20 percent more visual terror than you\'re probably expecting. Plus, the presence of a scary clown should automatically trigger a special MPAA rating. (PG-C?) Take your 5-year-old knowing that he may be visiting your bed every night between now and Halloween.',mixed
'What everyone will remember about Goosebumps is .?.?. nothing. Except that it was kinda like Gremlins.',mixed
'A film that assembles many of the author\'s most memorable creations with noisy, tossed-off sloppiness.',mixed
'There\'s hardly a shred of cleverness to be found amid all the predictabilities.',mixed
'Jack Black\'s mildly theatrical, knowingly hammy performance is but one of this horror-comedy\'s overdone elements, and the film fails to rise above the level of perfunctory effects-driven spectacle.',mixed
'The ADD overload combined with an understandably kid-friendly approach to horror (no one\'s ever in real danger, and the monsters are never too scary) results in a disposable product intended to appeal to everyone but likely to resonate with no one.',mixed
'Newbie director Aleksander Bach handles the project with a competent precision. The film doesn\'t rise above the genre and the plot is muddled, but he pulls off the basic elements with a distinctly chilly European style.',mixed
'In this post-Mad Max: Fury Road action movie age, occasionally bonkers just doesn\'t cut it anymore.',mixed
'Hitman: Agent 47 might offer a passable diversion for action junkies but, for everyone else, it\'s best avoided.',mixed
'Delve into the story at your own risk, but embrace the unrepentant stupidity of it all and there\'s a zen-like joy to be found in this screenvomit of adolescent violence.',mixed
'At the end, the door is left open for a sequel, but Agent 47 doesn\'t feel like a character who\'s got what it takes to be a franchise hero. He, and the film, are lacking in personality.',mixed
'Consistently off by a beat, Hitman: Agent 47 fails to ever click into gear.',mixed
'This vaguely science-fiction action picture based on a video game (and not a sequel to 2007\'s Hitman) is an idiotic mess with a bafflingly dense prologue, an endless final battle, lifeless performances and anticlimactic twists, but it does have a degree of visual flair.',mixed
'After a while, you give up trying to make sense of the plot and sit there gaping at the car crashes, fight scenes, and shootings. The problem is that even the mayhem quickly becomes repetitive.',mixed
'For the haters out there, you could see where Sandler reprising his role as a cartoon Dracula in Hotel Transylvania 2 might just be the perfect metaphor: Yep, there he goes again, evilly sucking the lifeblood out of decent entertainment. Now come on, let\'s grab the torches!',mixed
'There are some nice messages of inclusion, but they\'re crowded out by a big dumb action scene at the end.',mixed
'If you enjoy Sandler\'s brand of obvious humor and don\'t mind noticeable Sony product placements, this inoffensive sequel is, like its predecessor, just enough for a Halloween treat.',mixed
'It skews very young, and for that crowd, Hotel Transylvania 2 works well enough. If this is Sandler\'s sentence for all the awful, lazy live-action fare he\'s fed his fans over the years, he and we can say he got off easy.',mixed
'By the end of this 89-minute film, I was absolutely on the edge of my seat. Not due to suspense, but due to my utter disdain for the infantile plotting.',mixed
'Well, put a stake in it. It\'s done.',mixed
'Hotel Transylvania 2, much like its predecessor, never aims too high, so the fact that it comes as such a pleasant surprise makes it all the more entertaining.',mixed
'Unusually for any film top-billed by Adam Sandler these days, there are jokes to please young and old.',mixed
'Hotel Transylvania 2 is minor, to be sure, but given the comedian\'s recent work, it still counts as a pleasant surprise.',mixed
'Genndy Tartakovsky is a talented director who knows how to telegraph what an animated character is thinking and doing and how to move a character in ways that suggest personality.',mixed
'The problem is, Hotel Transylvania 2 focuses so intently on parental neuroses—Dracula needs Mavis to remain his little girl and needs his new grandson to conform to his vampire lineage—that the movie itself feels smothering (especially on the heels of the similarly themed original).',mixed
'Some jokes actually work (a GPS-voice gag induced unforced laughter), and the whole thing is amiable and colorful and surprisingly low on body-function gags. It may not kill you to take your kids.',mixed
'Against all odds, Nashville series regular Peeples keeps the film watchable, delivering a capable star turn with enough flashes of soul to belie the script\'s artifice and credible pop vocals to boot.',mixed
'This movie sure means well, and it\'s just entertaining enough to (slightly) slip off the shackles of the great cultural conformity factory it ultimately represents.',mixed
'As silly and sometimes nonsensical as it is, the movie is surprisingly sweet and well-intentioned.',mixed
'To Chu\'s credit, he does work hard not only to legitimize 30-somethings\' halcyon recollections, but also to make the material relevant to a new generation.',mixed
'Fans of the cartoon should stick around for Lewis\' after-credits sequence, which introduces a dastardly rival band. It\'s the movie\'s best scene, setting up a sequel we\'ll never see.',mixed
'Chu and screenwriter Ryan Landels\'s take on fame is more fascinating than most of the film\'s drab, slow drama.',mixed
'Jem has less in common with its neon-drenched ‘80s source material than with the real-life Internet-to-red-carpet trajectory of Justin Bieber — a similarly generic teen idol with moves dully modeled on superior artistic predecessors.',mixed
'There are a few sweet moments early in Jem and the Holograms.... But then the movie\'s lumbering, overstuffed, unfocused plot shows up, and whatever high hopes we might have had for this latest exploitation of 1980s nostalgia are slowly ground away.',mixed
'On a thematic level, it remains wholly reprehensible and a fraudulent piece of entertainment. But at least it rips off some better films (Mad Max, Day of the Dead, The Matrix) with a good deal of energy.',mixed
'The movie may feel tonally consistent with the first, but it\'s also overlong and thoroughly routine.',mixed
'There\'s lots of eye candy, and the pace is fast, but somehow the movie falls short. You\'re forgiven if you get the idea that Scorch Trials suffers from middle movie fatigue.',mixed
'In Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials, selfish oldsters scheme to rob young people of their vital essence, sacrificing them in the process. It\'s basically Social Security: The Movie.',mixed
'It\'s not a bad movie. It\'s like several pretty good ones.',mixed
'Though Ball\'s workmanlike handling of the second in the trilogy, The Scorch Trials, proves mainly that he can keep a franchise from running completely off the rails when the tracks have been laid perilously near a swamp of dys-lit cliches.',mixed
'Left without a gimmick, The Scorch Trials wanders between YA cliches — there\'s a Resistance, but it\'s unclear what they\'re resisting — and zombie movie tropes, with the obligatory a zombie bit our friend scene.',mixed
'Starts at a sprint and hurtles at us for a good long, stretch, before it stops to catch its breath.',mixed
'With more action and less mystery, a returning director and main cast and a handful of sketchy new characters, The Scorch Trials makes for an efficient yet uninspiring sequel.',mixed
'The Scorch Trials offers virtually no character development and only hints of plot advancement, mostly just functioning to move a group of obliquely motivated characters from one place to another without giving much clue where the whole thing is headed.',mixed
'Director Wes Ball\'s adaptation of the second book in author James Dashner\'s popular series is the exact opposite of its predecessor, presenting a sprawling adventure that, when not liberally cribbing from more illustrious sci-fi forefathers, spends plentiful time fleshing out the dull details of its oppressed-youth scenario.',mixed
'The Scorch Trials adds nothing new to the unkillable dystopian genre, but it\'s at least less ponderous than its predecessor. The many chases and ludicrous narrow escapes offer respectable doses of adrenaline.',mixed
'Director Wes Ball\'s film is a mad dash from one place to the next, with little time in between for rest, recuperation or plot development.',mixed
'The second installment, which reveals some of the reasons behind their imprisonment, lacks a similar sense of originality and urgency, undercut by overly familiar characterizations and dilatory pacing.',mixed
'The Scorch Trials isn\'t a particularly good movie, but it\'s just fast and nutty enough to keep you entertained.',mixed
'Maze Runner: The Scorch Trials does pretty well. It finishes respectably on a scale between Hunger Games: Catching Fire (fizzle) and The Empire Strikes Back (aces!).',mixed
'The production design and effects for this apocalyptic terrain are way above par for this sort of thing, and evidence of a much higher budget than Ball had first time around.',mixed
'Scorch Trials ambitiously opens up its world with mixed results: gripping action, so-so script.',mixed
'While it\'s a woefully incomplete middle chapter, at least it\'s never boring.',mixed
'It comes across as unintentionally comic, because Scorch Trials is basically Fleeing In Terror: The Movie. After more than two straight hours of running and screaming, screaming and running, no wonder Thomas is tired. Even marathoners gotta rest sometime.',mixed
'The visuals of a blasted city are impressive but hardly reason to spend $10 to sit in a theater seat and watch a bunch of underdeveloped characters get chased by zombies for an inordinate amount of time.',mixed
'There are a number of laughs to be had in what ends up being an uneven but surprisingly likeable dose of low-calorie nonsense.',mixed
'Introduced in Despicable Me in 2010, those yellow, pill-shaped, gibberish-speaking Minions now have their own spinoff — and they still ride a fine line between irritating and adorable.',mixed
'Farty, burpy, fall-y over fun tied to a pretty inconsequential plot. Your kids will explode with joy.',mixed
'The new team thinks that if mayhem is funny, five times the mayhem will be five times as hilarious. That\'s not how movie math works, and too many scenes spin out of control.',mixed
'If Minions were a toy, you\'d hide its batteries.',mixed
'The questions is: Can the minions carry a movie all by their mischievous mini-selves? \'Fraid not. This origin story, while being utterly harmless and far from despicable, wears out its welcome way too soon.',mixed
'With its episodic stream of slapstick gags, Minions has moment of piquant absurdity, but mostly it\'s shrill-but-cutesy anarchy works as a visual sugar rush for the preschool set.',mixed
'It\'s a buzzkill to enter the world of Minions primed for a tidal wave of gibberish-talking lemmings to tear the roof off, only to see them once again led astray by the ordinariness of human affairs.',mixed
'Comedy and narrative demand more rhythm than simply scamper, jabber, fall but that\'s what Minions bring to the table.',mixed
'What Minions does have is abundant if relentless cuteness, which audiences are sure to accept in lieu of content; people love these little guys.',mixed
'You\'ll have to appreciate what fleeting cleverness you can here.',mixed
'The Minions themselves aren\'t as endearing as they are in the previous movies, maybe because there are fewer of them bumbling around, or maybe because they just haven\'t found their true supervillain love yet. Or maybe some sidekicks, no matter how loveable, just aren\'t cartoon-hero material',mixed
'Minions is product, pure and simple. Little kids will love it, but grown-ups will feel like they\'re being held hostage in a Fisher-Price test laboratory.',mixed
'Minions has idiosyncratic roots, but it\'s a franchise play all the way. Finally, even 5-year-olds have their own movie that mechanically cashes in on something they loved when they were younger.',mixed
'It\'s all perfectly OK, and even, at times, delightful.... Yet Minions doesn\'t add up to all that it should.',mixed
'The story [lacks] a clear narrative or emotional throughline to connect all of the film\'s setpieces.',mixed
'What\'s surprising about Minions is that it squanders these yellow oddballs\' new-found freedom.',mixed
'No Escape is xenophobic claptrap of the highest order.',mixed
'Strict plausibility isn\'t necessary in these movies, and while No Escape doesn\'t completely throw it out the window, it still inspires the occasional unintended giggle.',mixed
'No Escape is a tense but utterly predictable exercise in Western xenophobic paranoia and guilt.',mixed
'Unfortunately, No Escape can\'t stay 10 steps ahead of its misguided politics and overly dramatic storytelling and crumbles under its own preposterous climactic denouement.',mixed
'Whatever seeds of social justice and emotional nuance No Escape may be attempting to sow are undercut by the film\'s melodramatic valorization of family values.',mixed
'Filmmakers John Erick Dowdle and Drew Dowdle (As Above, So Below, Quarantine) serve up a horrific string of Sophie\'s Choice situations, in between the breathless chases and brutal violence.',mixed
'No Escape, while cruel, is often uncommonly suspenseful. And by pitting its white leads against the citizen hordes of Southeast Asia, No Escape is also uncommonly honest about the fears and assumptions that fuel adventure fiction — here, the Other is not abstracted away to orcs or aliens.',mixed
'No Escape is a pedestrian but modestly gripping nerve-jangler from writer-director John Erick Dowdle.',mixed
'Despite its illegible chase scenes, awkward slow-motion shots, and fumbling attempts at political commentary, No Escape manages to be intermittently interesting, thanks to an off-beat supporting turn from Pierce Brosnan.',mixed
'A preposterous, monotonous action saga primarily notable for boasting a miscast lead and advancing a less-than-tolerant geopolitical fantasy.',mixed
'I won\'t make a case for No Escape being a good film; the first half is pretty good and the second half ranges from pretty bad to truly awful. Nor will I deny having enjoyed quite a bit of it as a zombie film, never mind that it\'s supposed to be an international thriller with contemporary political significance.',mixed
'There\'s no fleeing the clunkiness in No Escape.',mixed
'Bang, boom, bam. That\'s about the size of things in No Escape, a movie banking on its admittedly first-rate action drowning out its political tone-deafness.',mixed
'Directed breathlessly by John Erick Dowdle (As Above/So Below), the movie is filled with jittery shots from hand-held cameras, and hurtles along at a pace that is especially helpful in racing past the holes in the paper-thin plot.',mixed
'A Taken-style no-holds-barred family survival action film, with an inevitable side order of xenophobia undimmed by the indictment of faceless corporate chicanery.',mixed
'The dueling dirty tricks zing half the time.... But subplots involving naive volunteers getting their hearts broken feel like strands from a less ambitious movie.',mixed
'It\'s cute for a while. The stars are pros, and their scenes, often staged so that the characters are within breathing distance of each other, have snap.',mixed
'Politics is a dirty business, but Our Brand Is Crisis doesn\'t stick its hands into the muck sufficiently to be as entertaining or stinging as it could be.',mixed
'Director David Gordon Green\'s latest unpredictable addition to his resume is offbeat and appealing on some levels but is neither as funny nor as trenchant as it might have been.',mixed
'The film is in need of an edge that Peter Straughan\'s screenplay fails to deliver.... Yet Sandra Bullock seems blissfully unaware of the film\'s faults and delivers a performance that expertly plays on her strengths.',mixed
'Our Brand Is Crisis shows flashes of insight cribbed from reality, nibbling the edges of satire without ever taking a big bite.',mixed
'The movie unfortunately gets stuck between edgy drama and broad comedy, and most of the humor lands with a thud.',mixed
'The attempt is to create a reality wide enough to accommodate the extremes of absurdity and hard political truth, but the pieces never cohere, and so we end up with a rattling bag of disparate elements.',mixed
'A mixed-bag satire with ambitions that veer wildly from sharp political insight to slapstick farce to inspirational semi-autobiography. It never finds solid ground in any of those genres.',mixed
'Nominally a satiric comedy, the film is only sporadically effective, running out of energy before it reaches the end.',mixed
'Gordon is an eclectic director, and he has trouble with the tone here. It\'s not that cynicism can\'t evolve into something more useful in film. It\'s that the reasons should be more convincing.',mixed
'Green and screenwriter Peter Straughan never completely go as far as they might have, satirically speaking.',mixed
'The movie turns out to be something we\'ve seen before: an underdog tale mixed with a redemption narrative.',mixed
'It treats the complicated moves and countermoves of a major election as fodder for a broadly comic grudge match.',mixed
'Our Brand Is Crisis adds up to a toothless exercise in missed opportunities that is half cautionary tale, half political satire and oddly insignificant as both.',mixed
'The comedy here isn\'t very funny and the drama isn\'t very sharp.',mixed
'Green, who once had a solid and arty indy cinema career going, cannot for the life of him hit the right tone, here. The film is waterlogged when it should be jaunty, and the cynicism and the sentimentality are kept at arm\'s length.',mixed
'There\'s no denying that Pan is one ambitious fairy tale. But what\'s being labeled a wholly original adventure feels far from new, never mind necessary.',mixed
'In fashioning a creation myth for Peter Pan, director Joe Wright and writer Jason Fuchs have produced such a thin story that they reduce, rather than amplify, J.M. Barrie\'s famous characters.',mixed
'It\'s not about Peter Pan, but about what happened before Peter Pan. The noise you hear is J. M. Barrie turning over in his grave.',mixed
'This might have made a decent eye-candy musical for kids. But aside from Nirvana and a choral Blitzkrieg Bop by the miner kids, there is no music.',mixed
'Hugh Jackman gives the movie a bit of twinkle as a pirate who breathes pixie dust to stay fresh and relevant. Maybe the people behind Pan should have snorted some.',mixed
'Director Joe Wright\'s movie barely gets off the ground, and gets old quickly.',mixed
'If you\'re going to make an origin story, make an origin story. On second thought, if you\'re Joe Wright looking to tell us where Peter Pan and Captain Hook came from, maybe don\'t.',mixed
'Jackman occasionally wins a laugh, when he manages to impose himself over the movie\'s restless clamor.',mixed
'As Peter Pan should be one of the ultimate wish-fulfilment heroes for kids, it\'s baffling to see how he\'s been appropriated for such an awfully middling adventure.',mixed
'At no point in the entire film is any character allowed to have any fun at all, which is a rather devastating flaw for a movie that\'s supposed to be set in an eternal wonderland of play and arrested childhood innocence.',mixed
'Deftly made and diverting for young audiences but unlikely to linger, with any vibrancy tempered by the familiarity of the tune.',mixed
'It\'s not that Pan isn\'t entertaining. There\'s plenty of color and action and some inventive 3-D effects. Jackman\'s unhinged performance is either gloriously great or gloriously terrible, but captivating either way. There\'s no magic, though.',mixed
'At once thinly conceived and maddeningly over-designed, irreverent and over-serious, and chock-full of strained references (to World War II, environmentalism, and drugs, among other things) and creepy violence, Pan is an elaborate flight of fancy with no vision — which makes it strangely compelling in spots.',mixed
'The Ghost Dimension isn\'t exactly frightening — the setup is so well-worn now that it\'s hard to be particularly startled by what transpires — but it\'s able to wring sufficient dread out of this franchise\'s go-to fears.',mixed
'To the bitter end, the series manages to wring some fun, solid scares out of something other invading something utterly familiar.',mixed
'At its most basic level, the Paranormal Activity formula still has some kick, with its combination of creepy lo-fi video and tasteful suburbia creating some strong, unsettling dissonance.',mixed
'By making it so that everyone can see the evil coming, it also robs the franchise of one of its most potent pleasures: studying the frame for signs of trouble, little telltale hints that something is about to go horribly, horribly wrong. Sentient inkblots are a poor substitution for that sensation.',mixed
'The Paranormal Activity movies have always been about carnival-ride sensations, the narrative through-line secondary. That\'s fortunate, because those seeking closure to what continuity there has been will go home mostly disappointed.',mixed
'If only Ghost Dimension spent more time in the ghost dimension and less time in the people dimension, we might have had something.',mixed
'The screenplay doesn\'t lack for memorable zingers, and thanks to Cody\'s script and Streep\'s performance, Ricki emerges as a complex, self-contradictory person (even if most of the supporting characters don\'t).',mixed
'Demme\'s film plays out like a catnapping afternoon dream. We recognize the world, yet the logic is screwy.',mixed
'Ricki and the Flash\'s emotional intensity creeps up on you, and it\'s all due to the performances. Everyone\'s sympathetic, everyone\'s got depth.',mixed
'Even with its well-observed moments, the movie\'s nonmusical interactions, whether reaching for laughs or poignancy, too often feel flat and forced.',mixed
'This is a shaggy, easily distractible film that consistently defies expectations to both charming and baffling effect.',mixed
'Strutting around for most of the film in her leather rocker duds, Streep\'s Ricki Rendazzo is almost as much of a concoction as her witch in Into the Woods. She wears her uniform as a taunt and also as a way of defining herself. She\'s a woman out of time – a superannuated hippie.',mixed
'A classic, and classically lamentable, good-news/bad news proposition. In the good news department, it\'s largely a sturdy, enjoyable domestic comedy drama.',mixed
'Finally - and the news should really come as a relief - here is a role Streep should not have tried, in a movie that should not have been made.',mixed
'Ricki\'s attitudes, and their place in the family and the society she inhabits, are the most interesting part of the movie, or at least they would be if Ms. Cody and Mr. Demme were not so weirdly conflict-averse.',mixed
'As an actor, Meryl Streep is incapable of making false moves. That doesn\'t mean she\'s incapable of making false movies.',mixed
'Ricki and the Flash is a sour movie masquerading as something more cheerful. In that attempted deception the film is both helped and hindered by an indispensable performance by star Meryl Streep.',mixed
'If only Streep would have put down the microphone and let Springfield sing Jessie\'s Girl, Ricki and the Flash might have had half a chance.',mixed
'It helps that Kevin Kline excels as Ricki\'s ex, and Mamie Gummer, Streep\'s real-life daughter, imbues the fictional version with rare grit and grace. Otherwise, too many wrong notes.',mixed
'Why does this film, with so many first-rate artists in its corner, not quite work? Partly it\'s a matter of style, but mostly it\'s because the script is made of tin.',mixed
'The movie itself seems equally divided between the sensibilities of hyperverbal writer Diablo Cody and music-centric director Jonathan Demme, and ends up falling into a muddy gap between the two.',mixed
'Ricki And the Flash is about mistakes, regrets, and of course, redemption, but all of it feels a little too neat, familiar and convenient even if no one\'s quite belting out Kumbaya by the end.',mixed
'Sorry. The sight of the 66-year-old Streep gyrating her way through Wooly Bully has a way of blocking out rational thought. It\'s frightening but temporary, like a bad dream. Or this movie.',mixed
'This is a talented cast working for a talented director in a film that never reaches the heights it should have.',mixed
'Seeking spontaneity and release for her character, Ms. Streep gets stuck in a laboriousness that I don\'t want to belabor, since her efforts are gallant — she does her own singing and playing — and there are fleeting moments of real fun. Still, it\'s hard not to wonder why so much in the movie went so wrong.',mixed
'The story here, like a lot of bar bands, goes loud to cover up mediocrity. When Streep sings, though, so does the film.',mixed
'The music so wholly engulfs the second half of the film, there\'s no room left to expand on characters that feel less than lived-in or on the film\'s more ambitious ideas.',mixed
'The gaps between the hipster comedy of the star, the incipient sentimentality of the story and the gravely depressing reality of the setting provide tonal abysses simply too vast to bridge in Rock the Kasbah, an intermittently amusing but dramatically problematic mish-mash that careens all over a rough and rocky road.',mixed
'This lame, laugh-starved script makes him look like an Old Man — not a funny old man or a Grumpy old man (see the fine St. Vincent for that). Just old and not really up to trying too hard.',mixed
'It\'s Ishtar with the passion and sincerity replaced with a surface-level shrug.',mixed
'Rarely has a mainstream comedy boasting this much talent been so structurally amateurish, to the point that the film\'s lack of humor seems a secondary problem to its more pressing storytelling incoherence.',mixed
'There might be a decent movie in here somewhere, if the focus had been on the right character.',mixed
'Bruce Willis shows up, in full Bruce yippee-ki-yay, mofo Willis mode, to little effect, and while Hudson\'s sassy camp follower is a hoot, there are just too many narratively bizarre subplots falling out all over the place.',mixed
'The film often plays like everyone making it agreed that some on-set idea was so funny it had to be included, whether or not it suited the story.',mixed
'Your enjoyment of all this will probably depend heavily on your willingness to let the words romp and Taliban coexist for approximately two hours. The movie itself is slight and sometimes outright offensive, though it\'s also intermittently amusing and not entirely unself-aware.',mixed
'The oddball script by Mitch Glazer (Scrooged), as directed by Barry Levinson (Rain Man, Good Morning, Vietnam), takes so long to bring Richie and Salima together, it deprives us of the kind of fully fleshed dynamic the story so desperately needs.',mixed
'In its favor: a breakout performance from Palestinian newcomer Leem Lubany and maybe the most apropos use of Peace Train ever.',mixed
'Some projects are just too misguided for the star to mug and shrug his way out of. Consider Rock the Kasbah at the top, or the bottom, of that list.',mixed
'A slapdash, sporadically funny cross between the infamous Ishtar\'\' and the mercifully forgotten American Dreamz.\'\'',mixed
'Rock the Kasbah isn\'t respectful of truth, or consistently funny in the way it lies.',mixed
'Levinson is careful not to make the Afghan people into buffoons, which is good, but it doesn\'t change the fact that these folks are cardboard characters.',mixed
'In the end, it is up to Leem Lubany, a beauty who hails from Palestine and made her debut in the 2013 Oscar-nominated foreign language film Omar, to lend a much-needed grace note as Salima.',mixed
'A likable horror-comedy with a satisfyingly high splatter count.',mixed
'It\'s all too dumb and ribald for most tastes, but if you liked all the zombie comedies that came before, well, here\'s another one.',mixed
'Genre fans close in age to the characters depicted onscreen should be appreciative of the enjoyably familiar mix of inspired comedy moments, smart zingers, grossout gags and nudity offered by the apostrophe-phobic Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse.',mixed
'This Guide is not for everyone; it gleefully earns its hard-R rating. But folks who enjoy their teen humor splattered with zombie guts won\'t be disappointed. Scout\'s honor.',mixed
'It doesn\'t have the laughs or the killer cast of Superbad, but there are gory giggles aplenty in this B-movie addition to the genre that displaced vampires once Edward impregnated Bella.',mixed
'It doubles down on gross-out sight gags that 13-year-old boys should find hilarious, if no one else.',mixed
'On the plus side, the film is high energy and moves quickly. And some of the zombie gore effects are fun, reaching nearly Raimi-esque heights of splatter during the climactic battle. None of it is really scary, though, especially since it\'s so predictable.',mixed
'Sicario occasionally seems a little too impressed by its own nihilism. Still, this is an involving, grown-up film from a director whose muscular technique continues to impress: one might call it pulp in the same manner one would a plate of minced meat.',mixed
'Mr. Villeneuve, aided by Taylor Sheridan\'s lean script, Roger Deakins\'s parched cinematography and Johann Johannsson\'s slow-moving heart attack of a score, respects the imperatives of genre while trying to avoid the usual clichés. It\'s not easy, and he doesn\'t entirely succeed.',mixed
'Villeneuve\'s proven he\'s got a strong punch. The trouble is, he barely aims.',mixed
'There\'s not much fault to find with Sicario on the level of craft or performances, just its rather sputtering momentum, and the lack of a higher purpose.',mixed
'Sinister 2 is far from perfect, but it has a nobility that\'s rare in much modern horror cinema.',mixed
'Although Sinister 2 continues the story begun in Scott Derrickson\'s creepily effective Sinister, it feels more like an unnecessary retread than an organic extension of the original.',mixed
'Sinister 2 may be ambitious, but its best ideas are, as they\'re expressed, dumb, unmoving, and repetitive.',mixed
'It\'s somehow both too drawn-out and abrupt — but it\'s got creepiness galore.',mixed
'Visual stakes are heightened here, to an absurd, laugh-inspiring degree, the deaths sliding into the realm of Saw-style ridiculousness.',mixed
'Sinister 2 comes up a bit short on creative resources, although director Ciaran Foy probably gets enough right to entice those partial to the original.',mixed
'Sinister 2 doesn\'t know what it wants to be, and doesn\'t add up to much.',mixed
'Featuring none of its predecessor\'s sumptuous pitch-black visuals and sense of creeping dread, Ciaran Foy\'s follow-up is a misbegotten venture at every turn, in large part because it follows the horror sophomore rulebook so closely.',mixed
'Not half as terrifying as Norwegian black metal, but still one of the better found footage-gimmicked sequels in recent memory.',mixed
'If Spectre has any saving grace, it\'s Craig, who remains the best non-Connery Bond. It is not merely his physical presence, which is formidable enough; he has a unique ability to make peevishness dramatically compelling. And the subtlety of his sense of humor is one of the better aspects of his 007.',mixed
'Granted, there\'s comfort to be found in the familiarity of Mendes\' film, which makes an effort to look back while also advancing the series. But there\'s a fine line between paying homage to the past and merely repeating it.... Spectre often crosses that line.',mixed
'The first act is great, full of dark portent and bravura film-making flourishes. However, the final hour disappoints, with too many off-the-peg plot twists and too many characters conforming to type.',mixed
'An unbalanced but never less than entertaining film, enthralling and deflating in roughly equal measure, and studded with moments of true, old-school glory.',mixed
'Even a subpar James Bond movie is worth seeing because, well, it\'s James Bond. But if one of the most successful and long-running franchises in movie history wants to keep pumping, it\'s once again time to change the formula.',mixed
'Despite a plot trajectory that changes so often they seem to be making it up as they go along, everyone on and off the screen seems to be doing it by the numbers.',mixed
'There\'s nothing surprising in Spectre, the 24th official title in the series, which is presumably as planned. Much as the perfect is the enemy of good, originality is often the enemy of the global box office.',mixed
'Familiarity is not without its pleasures. But Spectre is so confused and inert that Craig can\'t even sell the signature Bond. James Bond and Shaken, not stirred lines.',mixed
'Spectre, set up to be the Daniel Craig finale as Bond, isn\'t a terrible installment in the franchise. It\'s the lightest of the Craig Bonds — no sin in that. But like the end of Connery, the exit of Roger Moore and the layoff notice given Pierce Brosnan, it\'s a tired, trite greatest hits re-packaging of stunts, chases and fights from earlier, better Bonds.',mixed
'I know the opening credits for a James Bond movie are supposed to be silly, but the start of Spectre achieves almost orgasmic levels of kitsch.',mixed
'A drab, anemic machine, Spectre, may bring the spectacle, but it lacks a soul. Someone get Idris Elba on the phone.',mixed
'Watching Spectre unfold, lumbering and slumbering, on the heels of a franchise high is a shock, so much talent coasting this time.',mixed
'They have tried, with this Daniel Craig run of films, to elevate the Bond movies so they are more than just acceptably silly spy movies, and one of the reasons SPECTRE is so frustrating is because it feels like the collapse of that ambition, and it is in one moment that you can see the entire thing burn to the ground.',mixed
'In general, this feels like a film patched together out of endless hastily-drafted script rewrites rather than a cohesive vision.',mixed
'Yes, some of the individual stunts and action set pieces temporarily hold our interest...but the story itself is not convincing on its own terms, playing like a series of boxes (Bond asking for a martini shaken not stirred) that need to be checked off and forgotten.',mixed
'Like Skyfall, Spectre is loaded with allusions to the previous films in the franchise, undoubtedly providing much glee for Bond fans. The nods, quips, and general formula that audiences have come to know soon becomes weary and tiring, however.',mixed
'Sorkin\'s heavily heightened sense of drama works best when the stakes are equally aligned but, despite the film constantly informing you of just how incredibly important everything all is, it\'s disappointingly difficult to truly care about what\'s taking place.',mixed
'What\'s most difficult about Sorkin\'s intricate fantasy is not acknowledging Jobs\' darkness, but setting aside all hope of seeing the real man who inspired it.',mixed
'The screenwriter\'s signature verbal-diarrhetic dialogue allows for a nonstop blaring of actorly chops that, like the movie at large, is nothing if not committed.',mixed
'Straight Outta Compton soars for an hour before spiralling into a bloated, melodramatic mess. Still, it\'s worth it for the early ferocity, capturing just how powerful N.W.A really were.',mixed
'Straight Outta Compton doesn\'t shy entirely from the uglier side of the N.W.A. story, including the claims that their music and their lifestyles glorified thug life, perpetuated gun violence, advocated drug use and reveled in misogyny. Instead, Gray\'s film owns it.',mixed
'Alternately riveting and wearying, up-to-the-minute relevant as well as self-mythologizingly self-indulgent — as much of a heroic origins story as anything out of the Marvel factory — Straight Outta Compton ends up juggling more story lines and moods than it can handle.',mixed
'The partying is as bland as any all-purpose music video and feels more like another script signpost (and audience-pandering) than a serious attempt to get out what it means to be young, black, gifted, fabulously wealthy and much desired. Mr. Gray does far better when the story edges into heavier, more dappled realms.',mixed
'There\'s way too much inside-baseball money talk here, when a simpler plot—one about a band whose apocalyptic vision comes to pass—would have been plenty.',mixed
'The first half of Straight Outta Compton, F Gary Gray\'s two-and-a-half hour opus about the birth of west coast gangsta rap, is bursting with energy, exuberance and inspiration. The second half is immobilised by bloat and sanctification.',mixed
'Despite a twisty, juicy and compelling story, there remains a staid conventionality that keeps the political and thematic undercurrents from being explored as satisfyingly as one might hope.',mixed
'With a running time of 147 minutes, the film not only runs low on energy toward the end — internecine battles can\'t compete with the early excitement of gifted young kids making it big on a national stage — but turns ploddingly sentimental in its sudden focus on Eazy-E\'s painful decline, and death, from AIDS.',mixed
'Aside from these few flourishes of the outré and symbolically charged, there\'s little to distinguish the movie from any number of overlong hit-by-hit music biopics of the nodding-approvingly-from-behind-a-mixing-console variety.',mixed
'It\'s clear that Straight Outta Compton is at once too padded and too thin. It\'s as if the story of these real-life legends was so unruly and dangerous that the filmmakers became the cops, forcing it into submission.',mixed
'It\'s not that this material is, or should be, off limits in a movie. But The Diary of a Teenage Girl isn\'t exactly Lolita. Heller must think that taking a moral stance is tantamount to selling out. Commercially, she may be right. In every other respect, she\'s wrong.',mixed
'The Green Inferno will be gleefully offensive and unpalatable to mainstream audiences, who may be more similar to The Green Inferno\'s victims than they\'d like to think. No one could accuse Roth of lacking guts – even if he hasn\'t found the perfect recipe for them.',mixed
'The Green Inferno is less a riff on spaghetti splatter flicks like Cannibal Holocaust than a desperate-to-shock pastiche of guts and gore served with a wink to audiences with strong stomachs. You know who you are.',mixed
'Izzo, who co-starred with Roth-the-actor in Aftershock, is a fine genre actress, standing out from a cast of blonde women with her naturalistic performance and signs of courage and initiative.',mixed
'The film reawakens long-repudiated notions of white supremacy and such, but Mr. Roth is surely not trying to peddle them. He\'s merely seeing if he can replicate the formula of the subgenre. And he does, fairly slickly, in fact.',mixed
'The blood-soaked Inferno practically ends up a promotional snuff film for deforestation.',mixed
'The savagery here is rooted in retrograde myths that might have been easier to stomach had the cannibalism been positioned as a fantastical unleashing of retribution.',mixed
'In many ways the film feels like a regression -- it\'s more juvenile, less polished and feels less labored over than his previous efforts.',mixed
'Unfortunately, the unbridled shock value isn\'t matched by a similar investment in other ingredients that might have made this low rent B-movie worthwhile.',mixed
'As you\'d expect, Meyers handles the material with assurance and charm, and there\'s fun to be had in the odd-couple dynamic at her film\'s heart.',mixed
'The Intern is idiotic, unrealistic, Boomer wish fulfillment that has no business working on any level. I quite enjoyed it.',mixed
'The movie\'s ideas run out quickly, but De Niro is easygoing, and The Intern is indulgent good fun. Just don\'t go in expecting nutrition.',mixed
'The Internship delivers what it promises, no more and no less, and faulting it for not being a rougher, tougher, smarter film about how much we all seem to live our lives through our work today would be like yelling at a spoon for not being a knife.',mixed
'The lack of comic goals allows Meyers to write and write; a key emotional scene between De Niro and Hathaway late in the movie rambles on like a first draft, and the movie swells to the two-hour mark.',mixed
'In its portrait of a strong, independent woman learning to embrace her own ambition, desires, and future via the aid of an older male mentor-cum-father-figure, it colors its triumphant fantasy of female empowerment in a distinctly conservative, paternalistic shade.',mixed
'The Intern degenerates into a series of monologues about ambition and relationships and having it all. As the speeches pile up, our goodwill dissipates, and so does the film\'s magic.',mixed
'Nobody does visually pleasing, occasionally funny escapist entertainment about goodhearted rich people trying their best to do the right thing better than Nancy Meyers.',mixed
'It\'s only mildly entertaining, never funny enough nor smart enough to summarize the cultural moment in the manner of a Working Girl or The Social Network.',mixed
'Nancy Meyers is known for her obsession with kitchens — sun-drenched, timelessly chic architectural marvels that provide a safe haven for all the director\'s characters. The Intern puts a new spin on this trope: Robert De Niro is the kitchen.',mixed
'The Intern is a romantic comedy without the romance.',mixed
'Meyers seems content to make a nice movie about nice people doing their best to be nice to each other despite one or two not-nice things that happen along the way. That\'s all very nice, but not particularly the stuff of potent or rousing entertainment.',mixed
'For someone of De Niro\'s reputation, this Intern gig is a thankless job.',mixed
'A featherweight comedy in which he fetches coffee for twentysomethings and calls them ace and boss without a hint of irony. It\'s painful to watch for anyone who remembers the thunder De Niro used to have at his fingertips.',mixed
'The Intern is a movie outmoded in style and strangely retro-sexist in spirit.',mixed
'Mr. De Niro owns the movie from the moment he opens his mouth, and is staring into the camera and right at you.',mixed
'There\'s no edge to any character in the movie.',mixed
'Given the vacuity of the script, it must be admitted that Hathaway achieves something of a triumph. She\'s always engaging and keeps the character on a human rather than superhuman scale.',mixed
'The bulk of The Intern is a morass of wackiness, a chain of sequences shot in a flat and predictable manner that range from tedious to idiotic.',mixed
'It takes all the leads\' considerable combined charm to forestall the aftertaste of the pic\'s smug life lessons and near-comically blinkered worldview.',mixed
'It\'s a shame that The Last Witch Hunter ends up crumbling into another generic showdown of murky fantasy effects and snatched artifacts, with a final shot that is literally framed around a door to possible sequels.',mixed
'The Last Witch Hunter is redeemed through complex visual-effects work that aptly illuminates Goodman\'s netherworld. Further, Diesel\'s stolid performance is balanced through the supporting star power of Caine – even with criminally limited scenes – and Rose Leslie\'s dream walker, whose earnestness makes even the world of a macho witch hunter seem entirely plausible.',mixed
'The Last Witch Hunter feels like the first episode of a would-be series although, unlike some similar endeavors, it tells a stand-alone story.',mixed
'As Kaulder, Diesel does what he does, rumbling out lines of silly dialogue in his subwoofer of a voice. As far as acting goes, there\'s not much.',mixed
'In its favor, The Last Witch Hunter boasts some terrific production design and digital effects.... Less impressively, Eisner\'s movie is clogged with cardboard characters, flat dialogue and a sluggish middle act that gets lost in too much fabricated witchy folklore.',mixed
'The Last Witch Hunter aims for pulpy, comic-book fun, but it\'s never as fleet, funny, or detailed as it needs to be. And if you\'re looking for something above middling in terms of plot, characters, world-building, even action sequences, you\'ll need to seek it elsewhere.',mixed
'Like its star, The Last Witch Hunter is big, overblown and frequently incomprehensible.',mixed
'The director of The Man from U.N.C.L.E. is Guy Ritchie, and there are hints, in the Berlin scenes, that he is tempted by the murkier option. Before long, however, as befits the maker of Snatch and RocknRolla, he drops the shadowy chic, decamps to Rome, and gets down to silliness.',mixed
'It almost works. Actually, it does work, hitting the requisite number of hip notes. It just doesn\'t dazzle, and that\'s kind of a surprise.',mixed
'Mr. Ritchie tends to flaunt his wares like a store clerk, fawning over the clothes, chairs and cars, and his usual rabbity pace slows to a tortoiselike crawl whenever the actors deliver a lot of words, which gratefully isn\'t often. His talent, as he proves repeatedly, is making bodies and cars crash through space.',mixed
'It\'s a good-looking film and the three leads hold our attention, yet the lacklustre plotting and lack of narrative drive undercut The Man from U.N.C.L.E.\'s overall charm.',mixed
'Cavill and Hammer are made for each other, but the film can\'t always find the pyrotechnics to match their chemistry.',mixed
'While it lacks a memorable villain, and the central pairing fizzes but never sparks, the film gets by on its vintage charm and a third act upswing.',mixed
'The film is nothing but a sensuous rush of snappy period costumes, elegant beauties, dapper men, kinetic action and so-so quips, and because Ritchie seems even less concerned with story than usual, that blinkered approach very nearly works.',mixed
'Cavill and Hammer have each toplined major tentpoles before, so it\'s something of a mystery why neither makes much of an impression here, but there\'s a curious vacuum at the center of The Man From U.N.C.L.E. that almost certainly owes to its casting.',mixed
'Stylish to a fault and straying from the source, Guy Ritchie\'s The Man From U.N.C.L.E. revives a 1960s television hit for the short attention spans of today\'s youth-skewing movie audience.',mixed
'Ritchie manages a promising first act. But at the whim of the action movie formula, and ostensibly nothing else, priorities shift as the story carries forward. When we\'re asked later on to attend to escalating stakes and a dimming tone, we\'re simply left wondering what happened to all the fun.',mixed
'While Mission: Impossible has found a popular way to reimagine an old show for modern times, Man is immersed in all things retro — from the ginchy fashion to a jazzy score — but for an action adventure, it\'s a mostly tedious affair with fleeting moments of cool.',mixed
'Ritchie is a director with no instinct for the audience, and he can\'t hold things together for an entire film. He seems at a loss, from moment to moment, as to what he should emphasize.',mixed
'The period spy thriller The Man From U.N.C.L.E. is only intermittently engaging and amusing, and those portions of the movie that succeed are also frustrating. Because they\'re cushioned by enervated, conceptually befuddled, and sometimes outright indifferent stuff.',mixed
'It\'s not so much bad as dull and ill-conceived. It doesn\'t so much end as sputter out.',mixed
'How is that Vikander, who played the robot in the recent (and worthwhile) Ex Machina, was twice as lively and five times as human in that picture than in The Man from U.N.C.L.E.?',mixed
'It\'s got a few things going for it and it\'s not unenjoyable to sit through, but, at the same time, the tone and creative register never feel confident and settled. It\'s not bad but not quite good enough either.',mixed
'Looks great, sounds great -- what\'s the problem? Everything else.',mixed
'The early-\'60s styles are chic, the Euro locales are swank, and the music cues (including a nod to Ennio Morricone\'s Once Upon a Time in the West score) are fantastic. Too bad the plot and the lead performances are so lifeless.',mixed
'Being a mildly pleasant, passingly amusing light entertainment isn\'t exactly saving the world, yet the film crosses its wires to blow up even that modest assignment.',mixed
'There\'s some nice early-60s period production design and the whole thing moves along smoothly, if unhurriedly. But it never delivers anything like the punch of Tom Cruise\'s M:I adventures, nor the wit and distinctiveness of 007.',mixed
'The Martian is only partly a story about a man in peril; it\'s mostly a story about men (and a few women) taking control of the uncontrollable. It\'s confident, swaggering sci-fi, not the despairing kind. That may be why, as elaborate and expensive-looking as The Martian is, it\'s almost totally lacking in poetry.',mixed
'The Martian is ultimately a love letter to the spirit that saw humanity reach for the stars in the first place. When it\'s channelling that spirit via Damon and witty writing it lifts off, but then can\'t quite sustain its trajectory in orbit.',mixed
'It\'s a film about micromanaging, fixing things on the fly, and a lot of Ridley\'s gruff, technocrat personality shines through.',mixed
'A wide-eyed tribute to human ingenuity that packs enough snark to pull itself out of the black hole of earnestness, even if its fuel runs out partway through.',mixed
'The new Ridley Scott movie is fascinating and charming and crammed and overstuffed, and it\'s a curious case, too. It gets all the seemingly hard things wonderfully right, but then caves in at points that should have been easy.',mixed
'The film goes in for the idea of texture and tics and human behavior, but there\'s no conviction, and no real push for eccentricity.',mixed
'No one wants to live in the past, but in The Peanuts Movie, the old stuff still stands up, while the new story is just flimsy glue holding the classic bits in place.',mixed
'The movie is pleasant and charming, but when making a big-screen adaptation of a beloved classic and genuine touchstone for generations, adequate doesn\'t feel like quite enough.',mixed
'Unlike recent, sharp-witted examples like The Lego Movie and Paddington, there\'s zero interest in mocking or freshening up the material—think what Wes Anderson might have done with this—thus dooming the movie to nostalgic types only. It trudges along like that black, jagged stripe on our hero\'s yellow polo: up and down, scene by scene.',mixed
'It looks shiny enough to keep the kids engaged, but not so new and improved that it\'ll alienate nostalgic parents. The movie strikes that balance, adding a bell here, a whistle there.',mixed
'The Peanuts Movie isn\'t so much an homage as it is an echo and a call-back, one that certainly has heart but also feels dispiritingly riskless.',mixed
'The film disappointingly ditches the cartoonist\'s modest visual formula for a photorealistic 3-D playground courtesy of the animation studio behind Ice Age.',mixed
'It\'s disappointing and actually kind of cynical in its unwillingness to try anything even vaguely innovative with these beloved characters.',mixed
'Good grief! This painfully sincere animated feature seems aimed less at contemporary kids than nostalgic adults who might buy toys marketed for what is being billed as the 50th anniversary of the Peanuts gang for their children and grandchildren.',mixed
'Nothing nearly so wacky or grotesque goes down in this romantic thriller, but you\'ll wish it would.',mixed
'Despite its serious imperfections, the soapy escapism provided by The Perfect Guy at least arrives at an opportune time.',mixed
'Michael Ealy has a very ominous stare and Sanaa Lathan sells her inconsistent character pretty well, but The Perfect Guy is still just a boilerplate stalker story that proceeds more or less as you suspect it will.',mixed
'Substitute a cat for the bunny (no spoilers here about its fate) and you have the ironically titled, generic thriller The Perfect Guy that somehow wound up on the big screen instead of on Lifetime.',mixed
'Despite an appealing trio of leads, it seems likely to entice only those with an unquenchable thirst for thriller cliches.',mixed
'The kind of movie you keep wishing would just cut loose and go off the deep end. Nobody goes to these Fatal Attraction retreads anymore for serious drama. But this one is a movie torn — too grim and self-important to go truly nuts, but too silly and slipshod to work on a more somber level.',mixed
'Director Camille Delamarre (Brick Mansions) and his collaborators have devised a few nifty sequences.',mixed
'The Transporter Refueled comes up strong where it counts, with frequent bursts of ludicrously implausible yet coherently directed mayhem.',mixed
'Director and Team Besson member Camille Delamarre (Brick Mansions) speeds us from one action sequence to the next with a style that alternates between routine, clunky, and modestly inspired.',mixed
'Amidst this goofiness, Skrein proves a serviceable Statham replacement, capable of executing elaborate martial arts-inspired fight moves, glowering behind the wheel of his car, and generally acting like a cold, detached thug-for-hire who, deep down, has a heart of gold.',mixed
'Stupid, stupid, stupid — and it certainly knows it. You might even chuckle contentedly at its knowing silliness — that\'s sort of what this low-rent franchise is here for — but you\'ll also miss Jason Statham, whose deadpan self-awareness somehow legitimized the ridiculousness of the previous films.',mixed
'The Transporter Refueled is crass and nonsensical, but it is hard to hate a movie in which a medical anesthetic is administered with a nightclub fog machine, the weapons include a ringed life preserver, an escape from a moving plane continues by car onto a jetway and the touch-screen banking software appears expressly designed for double-crossing.',mixed
'The action\'s accent on Russian rogues, lethal ladies and Rivera-set car chases makes The Transporter Refueled feel less like a film and more like the world\'s most violent Vanity Fair fashion spread, all poses and pouts instead of the two-fisted, rough life of the originals.',mixed
'The first Transporter film in seven years is moderately entertaining and reliably ludicrous in all the predictable ways, but the film\'s new sharp-dressed driver doesn\'t possess the effortless stoic wit of the original trilogy\'s Jason Statham, which ends up making all the difference.',mixed
'It\'s the fun kind of crazy. And The Visit is undeniably, admirably intense when it needs to be.',mixed
'Unlike in some of his other recent films, Shyamalan never overreaches this time. Instead, he keeps things simple and focuses on the story at hand.',mixed
'While Shyamalan competently scares us from time to time and makes us laugh uncomfortably at the odd actions – aren\'t we snickering at mental illness? – he has nowhere interesting to take this simple tale.',mixed
'Despite a promising premise and effective Shyamalan twist, this low-budget horror film still underwhelms. The Sixth Sense writer/director is his own worst enemy in the choices he makes bringing The Visit to the screen.',mixed
'Shyamalan doesn\'t reach The Sixth Sense or Unbreakable heights, but his scriptwriting is livelier than we\'ve seen in years, and there\'s a sense of humor that was missing in even his best work. At times, he seems to be poking good-natured fun at his own reputation.',mixed
'If this was someone\'s first film, I\'d be okay with the small signs of life that make this merely an annoying film instead of a completely dreadful one, but for this to be the latest work by a guy who made his first impression on the general public by sticking to his guns and refusing to compromise his voice… unthinkable.',mixed
'A faintly-creepy, lightly amusing horror comedy that promises a surprise twist and a hint of heart.',mixed
'A marketable slice of hit-and-miss mischief that doesn\'t suggest a career rebirth so much as a larky side project that will yield more in the way of nervous laughter than quickened pulses.',mixed
'The Visit is not a head-scratcher, like so many of Shyamalan\'s movies. It\'s more of a shoulder-shrug. That\'s it? That\'s all you\'ve got?',mixed
'A bizarre, conflicted mess, horrifying when it\'s trying to be funny, oddly appealing when it turns the screws.',mixed
'Shyamalan has had some difficulties as a director of late, and it\'s understandable to hope that by placing him back in the realm of lower budgets and more manageable expectations he could impress us yet again; that turns out not to be the case this time.',mixed
'Shyamalan has long been criticized for serving up borderline (or downright) silly premises with a straight face and overtly pretentious atmosphere, but he basically abandons that approach here in favor of a looser, more playful dynamic between his fresh-faced leads.',mixed
'For all its storytelling shortcomings, The Walk is a must-see for its perilous, vertiginous, sweaty-palmed finale and its reminder that the Twin Towers can be remembered for much more than 9/11.',mixed
'It\'s extremely antic for the most part, covering a lack of real story with a lot of distracting quirk. Yet when Petit\'s foot slips out onto a wire thousands of metres from the ground, it\'s quietly mesmerising.',mixed
'The Walk is that rare movie that might please practically everyone, from viewers just looking for a thrill to those who might enjoy a story that sounds like a tall tale but winds up being discreetly poignant.',mixed
'A patchy biopic that only thrills when Gordon-Levitt finally steps out onto the wire. Still, for all the 3D showboating, it\'s a touching tribute to the Twin Towers.',mixed
'Recreating the crime for The Walk, director Robert Zemeckis does a crackerjack job with the thrills and a so-so one with the laughs (at least the intentional ones) and skips the deeper magic altogether.',mixed
'The Walk is much less than the sum of its parts, except when the parts are so good you can\'t ignore them.',mixed
'As directed by Robert Zemeckis from a script he co-wrote with Christopher Browne, the film limps through its first two acts, putting in time until the big moment.',mixed
'The story The Walk tells is, admittedly, an unbelievable one, so it\'s understandable Zemeckis should choose to leave subtlety at the door. Sadly, such an approach strips the film of tension, especially at the crucial moment.',mixed
'As high-class cheese goes, Truth slips down fine. It\'s a noisy, one-note rally for the converted that gets your pulse racing even if you\'re rolling your eyes.',mixed
'Oddest of all is how Truth whips through this, making noble statements about journalism while brushing off the failures to get it right. Mapes was busy and stressed. (Slow down!) The document authenticators had doubts. (Listen to them.) The source said he was lying before but is telling the truth now. (Don\'t trust him.)',mixed
'That\'s the nature of Truth: a promising build-up, dead-ending into prosaic pontification.',mixed
'The film feels dodgy, tentative and uncertain as to how to frame its own protagonist in a complicated story of journalistic compromise (and worse).',mixed
'Truth should have felt like a tragedy, a story about a monumental but fascinating failure of journalism, the flip side to the upcoming Spotlight, about the Boston Globe\'s Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation of sexual abuse within the Catholic church. Instead, Truth wants to make your blood boil. It succeeds — but not in the way the filmmakers intended.',mixed
'Cate Blanchett gives a ferocious performance as the steely Mapes, and she mines some genuine emotion out of the material.',mixed
'For a movie about the importance of objectivity, Truth feels like a biased and sanctimonious op-ed column.',mixed
'Vanderbilt chooses to present the tale with a lighter comic touch in the early stages, and it\'s a tone the picture can\'t overcome in its final third.',mixed
'The players are a colourful bunch, the film referencing is smart, the football satire sharp and there are delightful moments of visual imagination in the appealing animation.',mixed
'Ping-ponging camera moves temporarily distract from the haphazard structuring and translation.',mixed
'Kids still experiencing World Cup withdrawal symptoms may be entertained by this animated oddity from Argentina.',mixed
'It\'s easy to laugh at the arrant contrivances and heavy-handed dialogue in the script penned by Alex and Stephen Kendrick. But it\'s even easier to admire the persuasive sincerity and emotional potency of the lead performances by Shirer and Stallings, who do not transcend their material so much as imbue it with conviction.',mixed
'Should well succeed in attracting their literally faithful audiences, although its heavy-handed proselytizing and soap opera-ish storytelling will prove a turn-off to those who don\'t pray on a daily basis.',mixed
'Remake The Graduate today, and an adult might corner Benjamin Braddock and whisper, Startups. Debut director Max Joseph gives that a good shot, though the result — the EDM-fueled, drug-laced dream-crusher We Are Your Friends — is so sweaty and silly people may not notice.',mixed
'Zac Efron makes a convincing bid for movie stardom — and Ratajkowski proves she\'s more than just a pretty face — in this flawed but fitfully entertaining film, even if it all goes a bit Pete Tong at the end.',mixed
'It\'s not as terrible as the premise suggests, thanks to some flourishes on Joseph\'s part and an intriguing performance by Wes Bentley. Efron\'s absurdly winning persona doesn\'t hurt, either.',mixed
'The movie is visually inventive and with enough good moments and smart moves to never be entirely dismissible, while not strong enough to overcome its essential thinness.',mixed
'The action slowly builds and breaks down, with dance beats kicking in periodically. Not much resonates here; it\'s all facile entertainment.',mixed
'The film fakes emotion with flashing lights and a pulsing soundtrack, and before Cole realizes the music was in him this entire time (ugh), the story falls flat',mixed
'It\'s worth remembering that movies can have soul, too, if their filmmakers are willing to do the work to find it.',mixed
'The makers of We Are Your Friends got halfway there, and then lost the beat.',mixed
'Talk about a mediocre mash-up. Much of We Are Your Friends plays like an Electronic Dance Music update of a very good John Travolta movie — Saturday Night Fever — with a liberal sprinkling of plot elements from a quite terrible Tom Cruise movie called Cocktail.',mixed
'Ultimately too busy fracturing his story\'s focus and indulging in gimmicky textual graphics to really tap into either Hollywood\'s or electronica\'s magnetic appeal, Joseph\'s debut proves to be a film with mood to spare but nothing much to say.',mixed
'We Are Your Friends has its heart in the right place, and it\'s shrewd and cuddly enough to get a few likes. But it would be an infinitely better movie if it sustained the sort of trancelike sonic ecstasy that turns fans into fanatics.',mixed
'Besides Bentley\'s performance, the only thing We Are Your Friends has going for it is the occasional directorial flourish, with words on screen or characters addressing the camera or that painterly drug trip. These jolts are few and far between, but they\'re most welcome when they arise.',mixed
'As with Catfish, Joseph is there with his soulful handheld camera-bobbing, trying to convey the pensive thoughtfulness of a person who may not be thinking all that much. And as with Catfish, the audience catches on long before anyone on screen.',mixed
'The feature debut of director Max Joseph can occasionally be as entrancing and euphoric as the pulsating dance songs on the soundtrack. But even an empathetic performance from Zac Efron (and an impressive, nuanced turn from Wes Bentley) can\'t distract from a movie that mistakes surface flash for probing, zeitgeist-y insights.',mixed
'The big finish doesn\'t quite land, but in fairness, it\'s hard to make standing at a laptop mixing tunes look like a triumph. Still, for teens who can\'t wait to be 20, this will get \'em on their feet.',mixed
'Taking those Hail Mary passes to heart, Woodlawn is a heavily Christian sports drama that almost goes the distance despite adhering closely to the inspirational movie playbook.',mixed
'This overly long yet consistently involving period drama... could be described, accurately, as equal parts Remember the Titans and revivalist tent meeting. But until the balance tips rather too blatantly toward the latter during the final minutes, the overall narrative mix of history lesson, gridiron action and spiritual uplift is effectively and satisfyingly sustained.',mixed
'The whole enterprise is very much a mixed bag, but as films that cater to this audience go, Woodlawn isn\'t half bad.',mixed
'A better title would\'ve likely been 121 Minutes in Purgatory, since that\'s essentially where audiences will find themselves residing during the entirety of this dreary slog down a familiar road paved with painfully good intentions.',negative
'While 90 Minutes In Heaven has a professional sheen miles above the clunky products peddled by PureFlix (God\'s Not Dead) and their ilk, that just makes it duller.',negative
'It\'s certainly a moving tale.... Unfortunately, the film tells the story in the most prosaic fashion imaginable, missing nary a single faith-based film cliché with its one-dimensional noble characters, banal dialogue and requisite sermonizing.',negative
'The tedium makes us forget the cynicism.',negative
'Although this well-meaning film may appeal to its intended audience on a spiritual level, the result is a sluggish, clinical, largely dreary portrait that tends to mistake trauma for drama.',negative
'Rendering a miraculous premise dull, the film seems relatively uninterested in doing more than preaching to the choir.',negative
'American Ultra tries to combine a sweet, slacker romance with a slick, super-violent action flick. If that sounds jarring to you, that\'s probably because it is.',negative
'American Ultra hopes to leave you both shellshocked and blissfully stoned, but as perfect storm of aggressively repulsive choices, it\'s a queasy bad trip worth avoiding at all costs.',negative
'It doesn\'t help that director Ken Kwapis stages everything like a sitcom, has no sense of pace, and buries the theme of late-life friendship under a haze of sentiment and trail dust.',negative
'Despite Redford\'s enthusiasm and best efforts, A Walk in the Woods is a tedious journey to nowhere special.',negative
'Even when the film isn\'t dealing with women, it\'s contemptuous of the world in a way that rapidly becomes one-note and tiresome.',negative
'Both Adam and the stakes are so low, it\'s like watching 100 minutes of a slug trying to crawl over a twig.',negative
'Burnt ultimately feels like those sous-vide bags that Adam finds so worthy of mockery: trapped in plastic, with the air sucked out of it.',negative
'Although rich in cast, the bad-boy-chef dramedy Burnt is unremarkable otherwise.',negative
'A cheerless and unappetizing plate of piffle that deserves to be smashed against a wall or at least sent back to the kitchen.',negative
'Everything in the by-the-numbers script signals that Adam must transform himself from and abusive tyrant in the kitchen to the head of a loving and fully functional family.',negative
'For a story whose appeal hinges on the saving grace of getting a purpose-driven life, this one\'s got remarkably little of it.',negative
'Oyelowo and Mara achieve terrific chemistry. Perhaps they\'ll work together again — in a better film.',negative
'Largely inert and undramatic, what you\'re left with is a tedious sentiment: by the grace of god this horrible crisis ended without violence, explosives, or spark. Congratulations?',negative
'The thin story has been stretched like Silly Putty to feature-film length and the result is utterly see-through in its sledgehammer moralizing.',negative
'An odd mix, to be sure, but full-tilt performances from Mara, as meth-addicted, widowed mom-cum-kidnappee Ashley Smith, and Oyelowo, playing the stone-cold killer turned cornered kidnapper Brian Nichols, help this spiritual thriller rise (very slightly) above other, more hamfisted, heaven-friendly fare.',negative
'You\'re left with no real catharsis — religious or emotional. And without that, Captive winds up building to a big nothing.',negative
'For a movie about purpose, Captive never finds its own.',negative
'The film\'s so inflated with moral importance that it becomes ridiculous, a Lifetime movie shoved into a cage and fattened with sermons and platitudes until it is ready to be served up cold and bland.',negative
'The film by the stylish fantasist Guillermo del Toro looks marvelous, but has a vein of narrative muck at its core.',negative
'The director was Baltasar Kormákur, a gifted filmmaker from Iceland who shouldn\'t be blamed for a case of industrial filmmaking gone wrong — the culprits in elaborate clunkers like this are usually the producers and the studios.',negative
'A lightweight and basically unnecessary attempt to once again bring some cinematic life to one of the lesser teams in the Marvel Universe.',negative
'There are no people to watch in Fantastic Four, only collections of character traits and attitudes brought fitfully to life by actors who might\'ve mistakenly thought they were hitching a ride on the superhero movie gravy train by signing up for this misfire.',negative
'A superhero film with no power and worse special effects that attempts to rewrite a story that\'s yet to be told effectively.',negative
'This Fantastic Four, directed by Josh Trank from a script he wrote with Simon Kinberg and Jeremy Slater, feels less like a tale of superhero beginnings than like a very long precredit opening sequence.',negative
'A good cast led by Miles Teller gets swallowed up in a narrative that grows progressively more muddled and tedious.',negative
'Ultimately, what Fantastic Four delivers is change for change\'s sake, rather than change for the better.',negative
'Fantastic Four is so mediocre that its title seems like a violation of truth in advertising laws.',negative
'This is the Fantastic Four. Maybe someday they\'ll get to act like it.',negative
'The special effects look cheap, the acting is wooden, and the shouted dialogue consists largely of throwaway action-movie cliches (Let\'s do this) and B-movie sci-fi jargon (His bioenergy is off the charts!).',negative
'An unfortunate movie that does an embarrassing disservice to the decades-old property and is a frightful waste of all the talent involved.',negative
'From Miles Teller to Kate Mara to Reg E. Cathey, everyone on screen in Fantastic Four speaks in a flat, earnest monotone with a determinedly low-keyed air bordering on openly not giving a rip.',negative
'It adds more grist for the mill to the notion that studios don\'t hit the big red reboot button in any other state than a panic.',negative
'It\'s a joyless relaunch/re-imaging.',negative
'Fantastic Four is so bereft of all the things we expect from a superhero movie — humor, excitement, adventure, awe — that it plays like a drawn-out pilot episode for an upcoming TV series no one would ever watch again.',negative
'In turning his back on the familiar tropes of blockbuster comic book movies, Trank doesn\'t have a clear new identity for Fantastic Four to distinguish itself with, and the result is a movie rich with possibilities, but trapped in the basic structure of a superhero movie, with no idea of how to wholly circumvent traditional expectations.',negative
'Someone forgot to put anything fantastic into Fantastic Four.',negative
'A sense of heaviness, gloom and complete disappointment settles in during the second half, as the mundane set-up results in no dramatic or sensory dividends whatsoever.',negative
'Steer clear, Friends of Ol\' Marvel!',negative
'Given the level of talent involved both in front of and behind the camera, nobody should feel much joy — no anti-tentpole schadenfreude or blockbuster-busting righteousness — to discover that the latest Fantastic Four film is a catastrophe',negative
'The latest reboot of the Fantastic Four — the cinematic equivalent of malware — is worse than worthless.',negative
'A lousy script, unfocused direction, incoherent editing, shockingly terrible special effects — and, probably, panicked studio executives — have left its four talented stars muddling through a dull superhero origin story with zero payoff.',negative
'At best, Goosebumps is a who\'s who in the Stine literary oeuvre, featuring characters who were terrifying on paper but rendered toothless here.',negative
'The plot is just high-tech Swiss Cheese, filled with holes and smelling like last week\'s refrigerator contents.',negative
'Agent 47 is just slightly less dull than its disavowed predecessor — or at least its dullness seems less active, because it doesn\'t turn anyone as inherently interesting as Olyphant into a dour-faced killing machine.',negative
'Hitman: Agent 47, much like its anonymous title, is a film pretending to be an action movie instead of the real thing. It might as well be a commercial. Or, hell, a video game.',negative
'Writers Skip Woods and Michael Finch have a few tricks up their sleeves as betrayals emerge and allegiances shift. But it\'s not enough to make us care or to keep the third act from being a head-scratching mess.',negative
'For all its cheap talk about the importance of innovation, Agent 47 just feels like a copy of a copy of a copy.',negative
'Insofar as Hitman: Agent 47 is about anything, really, it\'s about the pleasures of being on location — from the gratuitous image of Ware taking a dip in a five-star-hotel swimming pool to the sight of Singapore\'s staggering Gardens by the Bay.',negative
'It often seems that Agent 47 is more concerned with landscape, buildings, offices and subway stations than it is with characters. It\'s a lost cause and we lose interest long before we\'re shown the exotic architecture of Singapore.',negative
'The movie — which looks and sounds like a more brutal Bond knockoff — is at least consistently stylish, though its tone is less assured.',negative
'Hitman: Agent 47 takes an austere European aesthetic and combines it with Hollywood mindlessness, and the result is like a guilty pleasure, minus the pleasure.',negative
'It\'s all as pointless as the asthma inhaler with which one character treats his advanced lung cancer.',negative
'Hitman: Agent 47 is aggressively awful, the kind of film that rubs its lackadaisical screenwriting, dull filmmaking and boring characters in your face, almost daring you to ask the theater operator for your money back.',negative
'It\'s the first feature film for director Aleksander Bach, and he shares the blame with the pair of screenwriters. His creation is a muddled mess that is briefly lifted by some fun set pieces, but never is more impressive than a 108-minute Audi commercial.',negative
'If first-timer Aleksander Bach\'s choices as a director are any indication, he\'s a filmmaker who cares less about characters and actors than about dubious surface dazzle.',negative
'Hitman: Agent 47 is tedious, soulless and, for a film with a relatively trim runtime, seemingly never-ending.',negative
'Hitman: Agent 47 is a by-the-numbers schlock action sequel that writes its own epitaph when a character mutters the dusty insult, You\'re dead, too. You just don\'t know it yet.',negative
'Dumb as dirt and just as generic, Hitman: Agent 47 trades brains for bullets and characters for windup toys.',negative
'Hitman: Agent 47 is a film that bears nothing but a passing resemblance to the game that spawned it, but that shouldn\'t surprise anyone, as it\'s all just a cash grab, anyway. No choice but to wash, rinse, repeat: cha-ching.',negative
'If this all sounds rather dull, that is because it is.',negative
'It risks offense by putting a typically Adam Sandler-ian twist on a tired familial trope, though such risks can often be the only thing enlivening forced franchise installments like this one.',negative
'Any message about the need for open-mindedness in life and love, however, is muddled by a slapdash plot that ultimately cares less about taking a stand in favor of progressive values than it does in superficially employing such feel-good ideas for unimaginative, hyperactive adolescent slapstick.',negative
'Hotel Transylvania 2 is what you might call frivolously scary: scary by mistake, or scary for no reason.',negative
'When Mel Brooks checks in to play Dracula\'s dad, harrumphing and looking exactly like Grandpa Munster, you realize Sandler and Co. aren\'t trying any harder than they did in Jack and Jill or Pixels.',negative
'Belongs in a less ambitious category of sequels, alongside the creatively lacking Alvin and the Chipmunks and Ice Age movies.',negative
'Where\'s a wooden stake when you need one?',negative
'Channeling your inner child, you may find solace in Hotel Transylvania 2, but in the end it has no bite, doing continued disservice to the Universal monsters it scabs out, and adding another soiled feather to Sandler\'s cap of mediocrity.',negative
'Reduced to a teen girl empowerment vehicle that trots out every show business cliche about sacrificing your values for stardom, the film is a non-starter.',negative
'Its one saving grace is that Chu\'s direction is so wildly inconsistent that it manages to produce a handful of genuinely gorgeous images alongside all of the cruddy ones.',negative
'Sure, Peeples has a nice (if unmemorable) voice, but the vapid storyline with fantastic overtones transports Jem and the Holograms into another dimension, one that\'s utterly flat. Control. Alt. Delete.',negative
'It\'s the screenwriting equivalent of Ryan Adams sucking the pop vitality out of Taylor Swift\'s deliriously produced tunes.',negative
'Larger than its predecessor, last year\'s The Maze Runner, in every way: in its cast, scope, set pieces and (unfortunately) length. But more also means more convoluted.',negative
'Every set piece brings to mind an Epcot Center attraction built from borrowed parts, geared toward reinforcing the young audience\'s belief that adults just don\'t understand them.',negative
'The trouble comes when somebody opens their mouth and you\'re reminded this is supremely silly stuff, and overall a much lesser version of teens versus the titans of post-apocalypse industry – a copy of a copy of a copy.',negative
'This film is making a wheezing, spluttering sound: the sound of a profitable YA franchise running out of steam.',negative
'One of the most tedious apocalypses to come down the chute in recent years, this series gets lamer, and lazier, with each entry. The only ‘Trial\' offered by this film is the ordeal of watching it.',negative
'By far, the highlight of Minions is hearing The Beatles\' Got To Get You Into My Life over the closing credits — the first time I think I\'ve ever heard it used in a movie. Otherwise, the prequel to Despicable Me is like trying to form a rock band out of three Ringos.',negative
'The marketing engine of Minions is undeniably powerful. This is something craftily designed to sell toys and theme park tickets and special cans of Tic-tacs. But it\'s not a movie. It\'s an eyesore.',negative
'The bottom line is that the filmmakers are working with nothing here — no characters to speak of, no interpersonal relationships, no story with any suspense or capacity to engage, and no script with any humor or wit. What can they do?',negative
'Every Asian character is either a ruthless murderer or anonymous collateral damage. A lot of locals have to die, the film suggests, in order for one white family to survive.',negative
'For all its genuine thrill-ride gestalt, No Escape completely short-shrifts its Southeast Asian players. There\'s exactly one Asian character of note, a Kenny Rogers-loving tuk-tuk driver (Boonthanakit). Everyone else is a nameless victim of the equally nameless mob.',negative
'Grittily propulsive filmmaking and solid performances from Owen Wilson and Lake Bell aside, there\'s no escaping the movie\'s hand-wringing manipulations and pandering sense of privilege.',negative
'Even ignoring the racism — which is pretty much impossible — No Escape is a cliché-ridden, artless relic.',negative
'This movie really moves. But a fleet of tanks couldn\'t help the brothers Dowdle push past the plot holes in this rancid mess.',negative
'No Escape is a film you\'d want to recoil from taking seriously, so it\'s almost a relief that its bungled execution makes this actively impossible.',negative
'It\'s just plain offensive — and not all that well made, either. No Escape takes the casual xenophobia of something like Taken, crossbreeds it with something altogether more noxious, then asks us to kick back and enjoy the ride. We don\'t. We can\'t. And the ride isn\'t that great to begin with.',negative
'No Escape takes pains to pause for some unconvincing speechifying about Western meddling abroad, but its showbiz racism gets an infuriating pass.',negative
'Between the script and the superior editing by Elliot Greenberg (Chronicle), there\'s an enormous amount of tension and thrills to be found here; unfortunately, they\'re all in the service of a movie that\'s reprehensible to the core.',negative
'Films don\'t get much dreggier than No Escape, a dreadful and creepily exploitative would-be thriller, low-grade trash that it is too silly and stupid to be as offensive as it frequently comes close to being throughout.',negative
'The only way that this film could be any more racist is if the Dwyer family holed up with Lillian Gish and waited for the Klan to save them.',negative
'Director David Gordon Green steers a clumsy course between crass humor and sudden drama.',negative
'It only serves to validate George Clooney\'s devotion to showmanship as Hollywood\'s current reigning poster boy for blue-state morality.',negative
'Even a better political satire would have a hard time keeping up with the bizarrely eccentric vaudeville currently taking place on cable news, but Our Brand Is Crisis can\'t even come close.',negative
'It has all the makings for Green to find that sweet-spot between drama and comedy, and make something special. Instead, we\'re left with something exasperatingly bland and almost claustrophobically generic.',negative
'It\'s the kind of film that can\'t even bother to commit to its own cynicism, which makes it the most deeply cynical kind of film there is.',negative
'This satire, directed by David Gordon Green from a screenplay by Peter Straughan, suffers from deficits of wit, wisdom, focus, filmmaking expertise and appropriate tone. It\'s a case study, if nothing else, of starting with a dubious idea and making it downright awful.',negative
'Whatever drugs director Joe Wright may or may not have been on when he wrestled Pan to the ground, pulverizing the material into a quivering mound of monkey-bread dough, you can trust that they were synthetic. Not a single emotional moment in this entire origin story for J.M. Barrie\'s Peter Pan, Captain Hook, and Neverland feels organic.',negative
'Writer Simon Fuchs begins with a reasonable idea – we\'re all likely to be curious about the origins of Peter Pan – and does unreasonable things ever after.',negative
'Pan doesn\'t deliver on its own promise. The movie doesn\'t so much enhance our understanding of the flying boy as it demonstrates how little thought went into crafting his back story.',negative
'Careens helplessly between the garish and the generic.',negative
'The dominant emotion in Pan is the desperation of the filmmakers, who frantically try to pander to a young audience they don\'t seem to respect, understand or trust.',negative
'Ill-conceived from any number of angles, this Peter Pan origin story, scripted by Jason Fuchs (Ice Age: Continental Drift), plays topsy-turvy with J.M. Barrie\'s beloved characters.',negative
'What fun there is falls to Jackman, who gives the grand old man of pirate characters plenty of fresh and unusual wrinkles and emerges better than the others simply by virtue of playing a two-dimensional, rather than one-dimensional, figure.',negative
'Joe Wright\'s origin story of Peter and the lost boys has to be the dimmest, deadliest take ever on J.M. Barrie\'s Pan myth.',negative
'A complete washout, a joyless, pointless and fundamentally idiotic enterprise.',negative
'The most joyless revisionism since Disney\'s The Lone Ranger.',negative
'To begin with, the very premise feels off. Peter Pan isn\'t a superhero and doesn\'t really need an origin story, especially one that opens at a London orphanage for boys during the Blitz and borrows heavily from the Oliver Twist handbook.',negative
'With no clear purpose in telling the story and no real focus in the actual storytelling, Pan never gets off the ground.',negative
'Pan is a cacophonous assault on the senses, all computerized cinematographic mayhem and deafening noise, and its hurried pace extinguishes any genuine character development.',negative
'A thoroughly unpleasant experience.',negative
'This joyless, 10-megaton bomb fails in just about every imaginable way, as well as some you couldn\'t possibly imagine.',negative
'The movie\'s climactic exorcism jamboree provides some relief from the movie\'s overwhelming dullness, and the final segments put the movie\'s 3-D to use, but overall, Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension feels like the last wheeze of a played-out series.',negative
'It\'s a test of one\'s tolerance for watching predominantly empty frames – the anonymous performers scarcely count – in the hope something will jolt us from mounting tedium.',negative
'The sixth time is not the charm with this load of hooey that tries to make up for its lack of legitimate scares or basic narrative clarity by adding the alleged miracle of 3-D into the mix.',negative
'Even at this late stage in the evolution of the franchise, logical lapses in filmmaking technique undercut the integrity of the found-footage format.... What may be less acceptable, however, is the film\'s unaccountably weak effort to sort out the mythology concerning the series of demonic hauntings.',negative
'There may well be new and novel ways to spark audience shivers from not-so-bright homeowners inexplicably using their cameraphones to check out bumps in the night, but this series clearly has neither the patience nor the inclination to look for them anymore.',negative
'The most shocking thing about Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension, is that four hacks fought to have their names listed in the credits under screenplay.',negative
'Still, The Haunting these films are not.',negative
'It\'s fine to forfeit elements like stakes or suspense for a character piece, but when the characters are this vague, there\'s nothing on which to hang your hat (or headband, for that matter).',negative
'Star vehicles this rickety have a way of making the world unsafe for comic democracy.',negative
'Old-school Bill Murray, deadpan and gonzo, spices up the amiable mess that is Rock the Kasbah. That\'s both a saving grace and a curse. Because while Murray and his laid-back riffs anchor this oil spill of a story, he needs a more tangible movie to latch onto, and all he gets is a mirage.',negative
'The cast of old pros (including Bruce Willis as a soldier of fortune) amble through amiably enough, but a few laughs here and there aren\'t enough to make this movie come together in a satisfying way.',negative
'This is an unholy mess — a jumbled, tone-deaf satire in which seemingly vital characters are introduced and then inexplicably disappear, never to return; superb actors disappoint by relying on old tricks they\'ve used to much better effect in much better films, and every attempt at political commentary comes across as ham-handed and naïve.',negative
'Sexist, racist, overlong, dull, visually ugly and, worst of all, unfunny, Kasbah squanders its cast.',negative
'Murray blusters and hams his way through the first two acts before turning all mushy in the third.',negative
'Walking out of the film, I might have given it a C+ or a C based purely on the fumes of Murray\'s better work that are present here, but the more I\'ve thought about it, the more infuriating it is to see something this lazy and familiar from Murray at this point.',negative
'The film quickly settles into a depressingly one-note groove as a culture-clashing circus act.',negative
'Although no one comes off looking especially good, an acceptable alternate title for the film could be The Ugly Americans, because Mitch Glazer\'s script takes some of the worst stereotypes about ex-pats and blows them sky high.',negative
'The air of mourning might have worked as a counterpoint to the silliness if Mitch Glazer\'s script had smart gags, but as one-liner after one-liner misses its mark, you begin to feel sorry for Murray, who\'s really too old to be playing a guy who has a little daughter (not granddaughter) and likes to get kinky with Kate Hudson as a raucous, Dolly Parton–style hooker-businesswoman.',negative
'A stunningly misjudged comedy, Rock The Kasbah stretches and strains Bill Murray\'s deadpan nonchalance until it snaps, and what results is a singularly unfunny, often infuriating tale.',negative
'Laughs are few, attempts at feel-good catharsis fizzle out limply, and all of Murray\'s most elaborate performance setpieces — especially his endless rendition of Smoke on the Water for tribal elders — fall embarrassingly flat.',negative
'There\'s a special variety of infuriating that comes from a bad movie by talented people.',negative
'Rock the Kasbah is a pandering, poorly assembled botch that thinks it\'s playing fair by Afghan popular culture but only manages to add insult to the countless other injuries inflicted upon that country. If it were any worse, they\'d be screening it as evidence at The Hague.',negative
'Clichéd, enervating, insulting — it\'s tough to settle on a single pejorative for Rock the Kasbah, though abysmal might do.',negative
'No one doesn\'t love Bill Murray, but his melancholy torpor can wear thin in the best of circumstances, and these circumstances are pretty close to the worst. The cast includes Bruce Willis, Kate Hudson, Danny McBride and Scott Caan. No one escapes unscathed.',negative
'If you\'re not too undone by agitation with Carter\'s umpteenth quip about the female body, you may even work up a smile over some of these sweeter moments involving the uniformed trio.',negative
'A horror-comedy that takes a weak premise (do high school boys even go scouting anymore?) and barely uses it, anyway.',negative
'The flick is an artless, puerile shadow of the likes of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg\'s Cornetto trilogy.',negative
'Loud, repellent, badly written, indifferently directed and almost completely devoid of any genuine laughs, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse is essentially a film for 12-year-old boys who can still derive some kind of basic entertainment for the mere sight of spurting blood or a bare breast, all the better if they can appear at the same time',negative
'A witless undead retread served up as a vulgar revenge-of-the-dorks comedy.',negative
'Sheridan proves he can still act the crap out of a movie, even when crap is all the movie has to offer.',negative
'A disregard for the rules established by George Romero (or the alternatives imagined by Danny Boyle) is far from the only problem with Christopher Landon\'s film, which does prove one thing fairly handily: Even beings deprived of the intellect and spirit granted to living humans can team up to produce a major studio motion picture.',negative
'The aim here seems to be to replace startled gasps with shocked guffaws. The results are contrary to Scout Law — not Kind, Clean or Reverent.',negative
'The gags are mostly puerile and uninspired — like the film was dreamed up by a bunch of tired, wired 13-year-olds; it has their insistence but little of their invention.',negative
'Nothing about Sinister 2 comes close to the feel-bad ode to literally and figuratively dark interiors that distinguished the title-earning original.',negative
'Despite Mr. Ransone\'s goofy charm, Sinister 2 can\'t claim the same finesse, substituting pedestrian plotting and a more graphic gore for the original\'s restraint.',negative
'A retread of such brainless, shameless lameness that it\'s hard to imagine anyone begging for another installment.',negative
'For all its shocks and wannabe-disturbing imagery (trapped Bible-thumpers being mauled by rats etc.), nothing in Sinister 2 comes across as believably scary.',negative
'Not a moment of Sinister 2 is convincing or frightening.',negative
'It merely exudes an aura of cheap manipulation by which the audience is simply asked to rank the film\'s characters on a d-bag scale and root for their survival, or destruction, accordingly.',negative
'Say one thing for these killer kids: they\'re creative.',negative
'Sinister 2 has so little connection to the first film (save for the home movies) that if you see enough horror movies, you will strain to recall the original.',negative
'A license to kill is also a license to not kill, M lectures his new boss in the 24th James Bond film, Spectre. Well, it\'s not a license to bore as much as this bloated drag manages to do.',negative
'At the center of the film, like a man trying to pull a donkey out of a peat bog, stands Craig: inexpressive, uninflected and obviously tired. Perhaps he\'s trying to play a chap who never allows himself access to his emotions, for fear loved ones may be snatched away, but he just looks like an actor who wishes he could quit his job.',negative
'We don\'t expect a James Bond film to be deep, but at least we should be dazzled by the seductive gloss of its surfaces. Aside from that stunning opening sequence, this installment feels overcompensating and dutiful.',negative
'Perhaps some of the goofiness was intentional — you can\'t always tell from this production\'s wavering tone — but Spectre is full of not-good things, and some oppressively bad things that may come to feel like drill bits twirling in your skull.',negative
'There\'s no humanity in this grave disappointment that justifies the passion his fans feel for the father of the iMac. Steve Jobs and all of the characters around him fail to come to life in any absorbing fashion. They\'re not real people; they\'re all hashtags.',negative
'The Green Inferno offers up extreme gore, unlikable characters and seriously confused themes (is it a pro-environment film, an ode to imperialism, a satire of social-justice warriors or a poorly sketched combination of all three?).',negative
'Finish your popcorn early if you\'re going to The Green Inferno, and save the bucket to barf in.',negative
'At best, The Green Inferno is a reliable shock and disgust-delivery system. At worst — and it certainly veers toward the worst — it\'s a racially reprehensible work that exploits one of the world\'s most powerless peoples. And no number of movie-geek references to Cannibal Holocaust is going to change that.',negative
'The film is measured and executed effectively to satiate horror fans\' bloodlust, yet its underlying messages are just so repugnant.',negative
'The Green Inferno feels like a retread of a retread.',negative
'Roth amplifies that exploitation flick\'s least interesting components (gore, cruelty) at the expense of all others.',negative
'It\'s clear that Roth was trying to say something about the brave new world of social media-enabled social justice, and public shame as a tool for change, but the message is garbled. That it comes wrapped in a horror package that just isn\'t truly scary or suspenseful is the real shame though.',negative
'Enjoying this rancid slab of red meat depends not just on an appetite for slop, but also a taste for sloppy leftovers.',negative
'Empty cynicism isn\'t a substitute for well-reasoned critique, and Roth winds up looking more clueless than the so-called social justice warriors he\'s trying to satirize.',negative
'The Intern is bizarrely retrograde, implying that every working woman only needs a cuddly Yoda daddy to make it in the world of business. It\'s soft in the heart — and soft in the head.',negative
'This clumsy comedy, written and directed by Nancy Meyers, turns an implausible but intriguing premise into a tale of generational collision that reflects dimly on old and young alike.',negative
'The spongy subtext of this and every Meyers movie is We\'re being serious, but we\'re also being FUN! No viewer must ever be made to think too much, feel too much, or be left out. She doesn\'t so much tell a story as lead a team-building exercise.',negative
'Nancy Meyers is unquestionably committed to her auteurist signature of giving her female protagonists their cake and letting them eat it too.',negative
'The script\'s messy seams also show in the parade of sidekicks that passes through Kaulder\'s door as a new threat develops.',negative
'Seemingly every time there was an opportunity to do something fun, The Last Witch Hunter runs in the other direction, creating an unfortunately heavy-handed, humorless, self-serious tone for a story that should be allowed to be a little goofy.',negative
'Watching The Last Witch Hunter is like sitting by while someone else plays a game whose coolness eludes us.',negative
'The Last Witch Hunter is one of those artlessly restless, exposition-dialogue fantasy-action slogs that, thanks to Breck Eisner\'s untamed direction, never manages to corral all the potion talk, mythology rationale and leaps back and forth in time into anything remotely entertaining.',negative
'Director Eisner helmed the excellent remake of George R. Romero\'s The Crazies back in 2010, but this film shows none of the lunatic flair for the ghastly that the previous film so easily served up.',negative
'This abortion of a thriller fails, utterly, and bombed completely. So even though there\'s a Witch Hunter 2 in development, don\'t count on it.',negative
'The movie left me amazed — amazed that Nicolas Cage wasn\'t in it.',negative
'There are two main obstacles to enjoying The Last Witch Hunter. One is your ability to buy Vin Diesel as an immortal slayer of evildoers plying his trade in today\'s Manhattan. You also have to swallow a by-the-numbers plot buried under an avalanche of fast-and-furious but underwhelming CGI effects.',negative
'A smorgasbord of empty calories, the Vin Diesel vehicle The Last Witch Hunter, for all its overstuffed visuals, leaves you hungry. But not for more.',negative
'This is a relentlessly unengaging affair, its derivative and logic-deficient script matched by flat direction and fussy, unconvincing CGI.',negative
'There are certainly enough dopey diversions here for The Last Witch Hunter to be considerably more fun than it is, but even its most extravagant bouts of silliness are hampered by desultory plotting and Eisner\'s oppressively synthetic mise-en-scene.',negative
'It\'s just deadly and dreadful, loud and obnoxious, convoluted and irritating, horrible and dumb.',negative
'Armie Hammer has given several of the worst performances in recent years — see, or rather don\'t, Mirror Mirror and J. Edgar. The big surprise in The Man from U.N.C.L.E is that Henry Cavill is even worse.',negative
'The chemistry between the leads is nonexistent. Cavill unsuccessfully tries to channel Cary Grant, while Hammer\'s Kuryakin has so much inner conflict, it becomes a joke that isn\'t funny.',negative
'The threat that this mess of a movie might be followed by a sequel is enough to make anyone cry uncle.',negative
'It\'s slow, lethargic, utterly lacking in charm and undeserving of the Cold War setting that is its best trait.',negative
'The Peanuts Movie is a sloppy mash-up of disconnected vignettes and rehashed jokes, all lazily reverse-engineered from the premise that a Peanuts movie is a thing that people will like and will happily pay to see.',negative
'The best thing you can say about The Perfect Guy is that it plays out like a gelded version of Fatal Attraction, lacking anything dark or dangerous. It plays it too safe, and who wants a guy like that?',negative
'A perfect example of how lame, lazy material strands good actors, resulting in a movie that looks great and feels less so.',negative
'It\'s a lazy, by-the-numbers bore.',negative
'The cast is solid, game, competent. And the you can\'t fault an audience for seeking a little female victimhood/female empowerment in their romantic thrillers.',negative
'There\'s certainly an audience for these thrillers, but imagine how big that audience might be for one that really works.',negative
'For all its high-speed car chases and extravagant stunts, director Camille Delamarre\'s reboot of the Transporter franchise is as punctilious as Frank himself – glossy in finish but a little uptight.',negative
'To be honest, this storyline is not noticeably stupider in theory than any of the other Transporter films.',negative
'A mostly dreadful reboot by director Camille Delamarre (Brick Mansions) that casts English youngster Ed Skrein in Statham\'s role as well-dressed driver-for-hire Frank Martin.',negative
'The titular Transporter is now but a blank slate serving the characters and mayhem surrounding him, a walking metaphor for a franchise that\'s run out of gas.',negative
'Cheap silliness abounds, including car chases that are more about loud crashes and CGI than the thrill of speed.',negative
'The first Transporter delivered an unexpected kick, courtesy of Statham, who made for a brooding, magnetic — and reliably kinetic — action hero. Skrein is an inferior stand-in, scowling like his predecessor, but lacking Statham\'s cool, coiled power.',negative
'The Transporter Refueled is a story of bodies: sleek, curvy, luscious bodies, purring for action and ready to let you do anything to them. They\'re hotties, these Audis.',negative
'The movie\'s ridiculous.',negative
'The chases are nothing special.',negative
'It appears that this franchise has hit a dead end, running on nothing but fumes.',negative
'it\'s overstuffed, undercooked, and needlessly complicated.',negative
'The samurai code of Transporting has been ditched, the budget slashed, the product placement upped through the roof. And it\'s the first of a threatened trilogy.',negative
'The Transporter Refueled should be put up on blocks.',negative
'It\'s a dopey, only mildly chilling, uneasy mix of horror and dark comedy, scoring few points in either category.',negative
'Shyamalan\'s script puts down reality shows, but this shocker works on the level of a game show, compelling audiences to yell out advice for Becca and Tyler as they steer through one trouble spot after another. This writer-director depends on hoary provocations.',negative
'M. Night Shyamalan\'s latest is well cast and strong on setting. But the dull thudding that resounds isn\'t part of its effective aural design; it\'s the ungainly landing of nearly every shock and joke.',negative
'What ultimately sinks The Visit is that Shyamalan, who had previously come up with new and ingenious ways to frighten us, resorts to familiar jump-scare tactics in which things suddenly pop into the frame, accompanied by loud sound effects. There\'s no real sense of danger, no menace.',negative
'This tardy rehash of fairytale tropes finds sometime genre innovator M Night Shyamalan clinging in abject desperation to the found-footage movement\'s careworn coattails.',negative
'Blanchett, as you\'d imagine, is riveting, even when she\'s saddled with the movie\'s on-the-nose dialogue, not to mention a handful of fairly contrived domestic scenes.',negative
'Condescending, self-righteous and sloppy, Truth is simply a bad film for which there are no excuses.',negative
'In a memorably bad summer for children\'s films, this, surely, is as low as things can sink.',negative
'The faith-based War Room is so named because life is a battle to be strategized, with, in the case of God\'s infomercial of a film, a large bedroom closet serving as scripture-plastered command centre.',negative
'It\'s only in the late going that the marital drama turns somewhat more authentic, helping to restore a bit of the audience\'s, well, faith.',negative
'Preachy doesn\'t begin to describe War Room, a mighty long-winded and wincingly overwrought domestic drama.',negative
'I lodge no complaint against the film\'s emphasis on prayer, even if, dramatically, it\'s not scintillating stuff to watch.',negative
'It\'s just a clumsily written, flatly-acted sermon built on some of the same stereotypes that made Tyler Perry rich.',negative
'It may not be as brazenly offensive as God\'s Not Dead or as spectacularly inept as Kirk Cameron\'s Saving Christmas, but it\'s still awful, offering all the forced humor and superficial substance of a half-baked homily.',negative
'Much of what follows is turgid and, for non-believers, ridiculous.',negative
'One can always keep praying that the next of these films will be a little better.',negative
'A plethora of beats drop but little else of note — musical or otherwise — happens in the Zac Efron DJ fest We Are Your Friends.',negative
'While I might actually go out and buy the soundtrack album, the last thing I\'m gonna say about the movie is friends shouldn\'t let friends pay money to see We Are Your Friends.',negative
'What hurts is that filmmaker Mia Hansen-Love did it better just a few months ago in Eden, about the French house movement since the 1990s. In this movie, James tells Cole the ideal EDM track would work up the heart-rate of the crowd to 128 beats-per-minute. We Are Your Friends never even gets us to break a sweat.',negative
'We Are Your Friends has no heartbeat. It flatlines, early on.',negative
'By the end, though, the original bits fade as easily as one song bleeds into another.',negative
'It keeps its distance in the emotional depiction of its relationships, particularly the friendships among the Valley Boy quartet.',negative
'Perhaps it\'s for the best that We Are Your Friends doesn\'t try to appeal to anyone outside its stars\' own kind. Fewer people will have to see it.',negative
'The movie takes something primally appealing and attempts to explain it, fetishize it, turn it into something deeper and more dramatic than it is.',negative
