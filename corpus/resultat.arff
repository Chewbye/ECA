'The mountain, grim and unforgiving, remains the star.',positive
'Based on true events, filled with stunning visuals and featuring more than a half-dozen of our best actors delivering solid performances, Baltasar Kormakur\'s Everest is a high-altitude roller coaster ride that will leave you drained.',positive
'Like the mountain for which it\'s named, Everest is rock solid. It\'s big, it\'s beautiful, it\'s terrifying, and it\'s merciless to both its characters and the audience.',positive
'It\'s a damn good movie.',positive
'Classily and classically crafted in the best sense by director John Crowley and screenwriter Nick Hornby, this superbly acted romantic drama is set in the early 1950s and provides the feeling of being lifted into a different world altogether, so transporting is the film\'s sense of time and place and social mores.',positive
'Director Baltasar Kormakur (2 Guns) essentially made a faux documentary with big stars and better lighting.',positive
'Anchored by another great turn from Matt Damon, The Martian mixes smarts, laughs, weird character bits and tension on a huge canvas. The result is Scott\'s most purely enjoyable film for ages.',positive
'Singular and stunning.',positive
'There are no winners here. Maybe that\'s cynical, or maybe it\'s true. But it\'s a bleak and sometimes powerful message that Villeneuve delivers with blunt force.',positive
'With a few self-conscious exceptions, Soderbergh makes an earnest attempt to return to that place and time in both history and American filmmaking, and his risk-taking pays fascinating dividends.',positive
'No movie could capture all the alarming incidents and contradictions that make up the complete N.W.A. story. But in order to stress the group\'s most righteous side, the movie downplays their youthful excesses as well as their flagrant sexism.',positive
'Carol is one of the greatest American screen romances of any era, period \' and perhaps that serves as the ultimate vindication of Haynes\' outspoken commitment to \'queer cinema.\'',positive
'Truth also ignores Rather\'s famous showboating, pettiness and hubris. He\'s worked in lower-profile gigs since, but trust me, there\'s a good reason why no news organization will touch Mapes with a 10-foot pole.',positive
'It plays like a Marvel superhero movie had Marvel been run by Suge Knight.',positive
'Even with his glossy new look, Charlie Brown remains the Charlie Browniest.',positive
'Crowley wisely keeps Ronan center stage and often in close-up. She lets us feel the pain of leave-takings, the depression of homesickness in that pre-digital age, the dilemma of first love, and maybe second love, overlapping, the pull of the familiar vs. the hope of the new and different.',positive
'A Lower key than Wallace and Gromit or Pirates, but tightly packed with charm',positive
'Blanchett gives this dynamo of intelligence and doggedness a real human dimension that allows the propulsive drama to breathe; it\'s another stellar performance that rates among her best.',positive
'What makes The Martian work is Damon.',positive
'Black Mass, a down and dirty crime drama based on the exploits of Boston gangster James Whitey Bulger, is thrilling for a number of reasons.',positive
'As breathtakingly gorgeous and well acted as The Walk is, if you had to choose between the doc and this solid fictionalized version, I\'d say go with the documentary.',positive
'There\'s only one star in this movie: Everest. Korm\'kur couldn\'t shoot higher than base camp, around 14,000 feet, without sickening the actors. But a crew traveled to the top to get footage, while much of the climbing was shot in the Dolomites. No matter. You watch Everest and you believe.',positive
'Shaun the Sheep Movie delivers exactly what it promises: The cutest, most innocuous entertainment this side of Internet panda videos.',positive
'It is sophisticated yet innocent, and while always accessible for young fans it never suffers from a lack of dialogue, with the straightforward and breezy story easy to follow and fun to enjoy.',positive
'At its heart, The Martian is an unapologetically stirring celebration of our ability, as a species, to solve even the most daunting problems via rational thought, step by step by step. It\'s basically Human Ingenuity: The Movie.',positive
'It\'s a more subtle, damning film for implicating the media \' as much as the church, the courts, the legal profession and other Boston institutions \' in the systematic, wider cultural cover-up it describes.',positive
'[An] enormously entertaining movie.',positive
'There is, in other words, nothing new in Hellions that you can\'t get already in earlier, more ambitious horror films. But McDonald delivers an effective thrice-told tale, and he does it with enough avant garde flair to show viewers that temper their expectations a good time.',positive
'Brilliantly acted by the year\'s most carefully assembled cast, Spotlight is one of the year\'s best films, showing just how hard it is to uncover painful truths.',positive
'The voice work is on-target - the child actors, none of whom have played these parts before and many of whom have limited professional experience, nail their characters. They sound just like we expect them to sound.',positive
'The Walk is broadly written with two clunky first acts that are saved, arguably superseded entirely, by its nerve-wracking, majestic and spectacular finish.',positive
'There have been plenty of mountaineering documentaries over the last few years, and Everest suffers in comparison to them simply by being a dramatization. As realistic as the effects are (and you can occasionally tell when a shot is green-screened), you\'re still aware on a gut level that Jason Clarke and Josh Brolin were not actually filmed at 29,000 feet above sea level.',positive
'The keenly focused intelligence and low-boil intensity that James Vanderbilt demonstrated in his screenplay for \'Zodiac\' are on impressive display in Truth.',positive
'Haynes\' commitment to outcasts, then and now, makes Carol a romantic spellbinder that cuts deep. It\'s one of the year\'s very best films.',positive
'A nuanced tale of mutual attraction that reflects a filmmaker and cast operating at the height of their powers, rendering complex circumstances in strikingly personal terms.',positive
'A narrative feature can do what the documentary couldn\'t: re-create the tightrope act in full, glorious motion, rather than editing together surreptitiously snapped photos. These dizzying IMAX 3-D visuals truly are big-screen magic.',positive
'Brooklyn balances its melodramatic leanings with several light touches.',positive
'Kaufman and fellow director Duke Johnson strike the right balance here, deftly mixing spiritual crisis and despondency with moments of painful awkwardness and biting hilarity.',positive
'The Walk is a visionary high-wire act.',positive
'It succeeds wonderfully, offering moviegoers a rare taste of rarified air -- and as compelling an argument as you can make for seeing a movie writ large on the oversized screen of an actual movie theater.',positive
'Both of its time and of the moment, Straight Outta Compton is potent and largely successful, and makes a hell of a case for why this was a story worth telling.',positive
'Those who go to a Villeneuve production, Sicario included, must be prepared for intense suspense, moral ambiguity, and an ending that doesn\'t conform to Hollywood norms.',positive
'The film basically upholds the verity of the news story while not condoning the sloppiness, and it\'s worth seeing mostly for Cate Blanchett\'s firebrand performance as Mapes, a battler consumed by righteousness.',positive
'After two hours of The Walk, I felt as if I\'d walked the wire myself. I was agitated and exhausted. During the movie, I was squirming and wincing, and a few times even had to close my eyes, just to find some relief.',positive
'When the lights come up, you don\'t want to feel like you\'ve watched a \'better Cliffhanger. You want to understand the tragedy you\'ve just watched. Yes, you want to be entertained, but you also want the icy, whipping wind of reality to sting.',positive
'If Sicario does not collapse under its own grimness, that is because of the pulse: the care with which Villeneuve keeps the story beating, like a drum, as he steadies himself for the next set piece.',positive
'Beyond its surface pleasures, Crimson Peak also confronts the demons of modern entertainment. The movie frightens and surprises us in familiar ways, but at the same time issues a plea for restraint.',positive
'Black Mass is a tightly wound piece of work, and Cooper (Crazy Heart, Out of the Furnace) keeps its many small parts moving with ease. He\'s skillful at merging telling, minute details with bigger, looping schemes.',positive
'While most other films sprint through expository dialogue, and bluster their way through action scenes, The Last Witch Hunter is measured enough to make you want to suspend your disbelief.',positive
'Debuting director James Vanderbilt (who wrote Zodiac) has a great sense of forward motion and wrings suspense from an idea-driven story.',positive
'Sicario is a queasy-making thrill ride through Dick Cheney\'s Theme Park on the Dark Side, with an enjoyable cast headed by Blunt, Josh Brolin as a bro-tastic but oddly sinister secret agent in flip-flops and Benicio Del Toro as a person of uncertain provenance (is he Mexican? Is he Colombian? Is he CIA?) who is approximately the scariest guy ever.',positive
'Beers\' screenplay manages to sustain the outrageous scenario with a string of jokes that don\'t take the underlying goofiness for granted. Instead, the writer-director builds on its crass foundations with constant inspired one-liners.',positive
'Despite the cerebral formalism that pushes it forward, Mond has made a genuine tearjerker.',positive
'Haynes has pulled off something remarkable here, without a trace of winking or archness. It\'s been a long time since the movies have seen a fuse of pure ardor burn this slowly and steadily, leading to such an unexpectedly moving explosion of resolve.',positive
'If \'Compton\' is undeniably of the moment, it\'s also timeless in its depiction of how artists and writers transform the world around them into angry, profane, vibrant and singular personal expression.',positive
'Crackling with energy and fizzing with ideas, this fresh take on Frankenstein is a thrilling adaptation that reinvigorates a well-worn tale.',positive
'Sicario is at its best when its borderlines are fluid and indistinct.',positive
'A fairly good, extremely grueling movie as far as it goes \' tracks the true-life fortunes of a battered group of climbers to the highest place on Earth. Yet somehow it doesn\'t go far enough.',positive
'A heartbreaking and poignant story about choices, country, commitments, sacrifice, and love, Brooklyn is a superb, luminous, and bittersweet portrayal of who we are, where we\'ve come from, where we\'re going, and the places we call home.',positive
'Crowley and his creative team \' cinematographer Yves B\'langer, designer Fran\'ois S\'guin, composer Michael Brook, costume designer Odile Dicks-Mireaux \' build a cinematic snow-globe of nostalgia, a portrait of two worlds that aches with family lost and freedoms found. It is a beautiful film to experience.',positive
'Though realized on a more modest scale than other Aardman features, the film is still an absolute delight in terms of set and character design, with sophisticated blink-and-you\'ll-miss-it detailing to counterbalance the franchise\'s cruder visual trademarks.',positive
'A charming and clever concoction.',positive
'I\'m not sure if leavening is the right word, but Brolin, as an enigmatic U.S. agent with a world-weary cynicism and a black-ops vibe, provides at least a dose of (very) dark humor to the proceedings.',positive
'It\'s one of the most satisfying films of 2015.',positive
'Tautly directed by Tom McCarthy (The Visitor), the film hums as a tense shoe-leather procedural and a heartbreaking morality play that handles personal stories respectfully without losing sight of the bigger, more damning picture.',positive
'The sound never loses its urgency, its sense of immediate danger, straight through to the closing shot of the film.',positive
'The film dares its viewers to consider that--for a couple of hours, at least--even when a thing seems too good to be true, it might not be.',positive
'Black Mass is like a playlist of greatest hits from other, better movies.',positive
'The film proves \' in both style and attitude \' a successful bridge between the old and the new, and one that, no matter its emotional slimness, ultimately never loses sight of the fretful angst with which all kids must, at some point, contend.',positive
'In Spanish, sicario means hitman. In film terms, Sicario is sensational, the most gripping and tension-packed spin through America\'s covert War on Drugs since Steven Soderbergh\'s Traffic 15 years ago.',positive
'The magic of Brooklyn can\'t be analyzed, but something in the richness of its relationships puts an essential truth before us \' the brevity and immensity of life. We know all about that, of course, but that\'s the beauty of great art: It takes what you already know and makes you feel it.',positive
'Straight Outta Compton is a hugely entertaining film that works best if you don\'t look at it too closely and just listen.',positive
'This landmark film takes a clear-eyed look at the digital future and honors the one constant that journalism needs to stay alive and relevant: a fighting spirit.',positive
'Anomalisa\'s existence is a minor miracle on multiple levels, from the Kickstarter campaign that funded it (the credits give \'special thanks\' to 1,070 names) to the oh-so-delicate way the film creeps up on you, transitioning from a low-key dark night of the soul into something warm, human and surprisingly tender.',positive
'Blanchett, a commanding figure who scowls her way through every argument, gives Mapes an involving screen presence that elaborates on the character\'s staunch resolve much better than the straightforward script.',positive
'A robust romantic drama, rich in history and full of emotion, Brooklyn fills a niche in which the studios once specialized, using a well-read and respected novel as the grounds for a tenderly observed tearjerker.',positive
'This is a wonderfully odd consideration of those questions about love, pain, solitude and human connection we all ask; its emotional power creeps out from under the subtle humor and leaves a subcutaneous imprint that lingers long after the movie is over.',positive
'Spotlight is a rare movie about the profession \' and just enough about people in it \' that simply feels right, speaking from the inside.',positive
'Even high expectations don\'t quite prepare you for the startling impact of Carol, an exquisitely drawn, deeply felt love story that teases out every shadow and nuance of its characters\' inner lives with supreme intelligence, breathtaking poise and filmmaking craft of the most sophisticated yet accessible order.',positive
'A lot of the information in The Martian will be incomprehensible to the lay audience and the climax is\'well, not exactly original. But it makes for one hell of an entertaining ride.',positive
'The opening of Sicario unfolds at such an anxiety-inducing pitch that it seems impossible for Villeneuve to sustain it, let alone build on it, but somehow he manages to do just that. He\'s a master of the kind of creeping tension that coils around the audience like a snake suffocating its prey.',positive
'What Zemeckis delivers here is an entirely different brand of spectacle from that which audiences have come to expect from recent studio tentpoles, sharing a true story so incredible it literally must be seen to be believed, as opposed to imaginary feats full of impossible CG creatures.',positive
'If history\'s tide runs against the Globe, at least those who worked there have the satisfaction of exposing a global wrong, and helping to end it. And they have McCarthy\'s film, one of the best pictures of 2015, as a permanent record, a tribute in cinematic form, to their art and craft in its finest hour.',positive
'Horror is an impatient person\'s game these days, and Crimson Peak isn\'t hurried at all. It seduces with creepily erotic atmosphere, and performances in perfect tune with the script\'s melodrama.',positive
'When you\'re watching something Zemeckis made, anything can happen, and reality is up for grabs. In this case, he\'s used his powers for good, and the end result is stirring and spectacular at times, with a devastating, if subtle, final line of dialogue.',positive
'Occasionally things get a little overcrowded, particularly during a sticky final act, but Pan has a certain timeless buoyancy that keeps it bouncing back.',positive
'So James White\'s title character is an entitled, self-centered a--hole. But the movie about him is still a marvel: an honest, moving, and occasionally even funny portrait of what happens when a cripplingly immature young man gets hit with one reality check after another.',positive
'A great newspaper movie of the old-school model, calling up not only obvious comparisons with All the President\'s Men and Zodiac, two movies with similar devotion to the sometimes crushingly boring gumshoe part of reportage, but also Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell shouting into adjacent phones in His Girl Friday.',positive
'A dialogue-free romp that is a shear delight, shear perfection, if not quite a master-fleece.',positive
'Zemeckis turns the event into a kind of blockbuster Cin\'ma Pur \' an almost avant-garde game of composition, movement and perspective, exhilaratingly attuned to form and space. (Mad Max: Fury Road did the same.) The camerawork is subtle and meticulous, the 3D head-spinningly well-applied.',positive
'Impressively designed throughout, The Unbeatables also keeps the laughs kicking.',positive
'You can argue that the plot of The Martian doesn\'t offer many surprises, but this is a movie of innumerable delightful moments and small discoveries, and even more of infectious enthusiasm.',positive
'At once ardent and analytical, cerebral and swooning, Carol is a study in human magnetism, in the physics and optics of eros. With sparse dialogue and restrained drama, the film is a symphony of angles and glances, of colors and shadows.',positive
'Like a great silent movie, it creates its pathos and comedy out of the concrete objects being animated, building elaborate gags involving everyday items transformed into Rube Goldberg devices that sometimes entrap the characters, or, when properly manipulated by them, provide a means of achieving their goals.',positive
'This dramatic thriller finds a spot somewhere between your brain and your stomach, and drills in.',positive
'Credit goes to smart casting of unknowns in the leads, who click uniformly; a packed script that manages not to feel overly long and social commentary that is timeless.',positive
'A sprawling, overstuffed, formulaic but highly entertaining story of pop stardom.',positive
'Depp\'s performance as Bulger is as strong, and as energized, as anything he\'s done on screen for years.',positive
'This is what filmed spectacle used to look like \' a trip to a place or time most of us could never see.',positive
'Brooklyn grabs us, holds us and moves us on its own. Emotionally it\'s a killer.',positive
'Making a film with fine performances, adept direction, first-rate photography and a doltish screenplay is like starting a rock band with no drummer. The result may yield satisfying, even memorable moments. But every time you try to build momentum, the project falls apart.',positive
'Like All The President\'s Men, it\'s a muckraker movie that celebrates the power of the press by actually showing journalists doing their job, pen and notebook in hand.',positive
'Despite its terrific performances and its great use of locations, Shelter doesn\'t have enough substance to hold your attention or linger in the mind for long.',positive
'There is no solace to be had in this raw, intimate drama, a feature-film debut for writer-director Josh Mond. No triumph of the human spirit. There is instead something rarer and more valuable: urgently personal filmmaking, and Abbott\'s stunning performance.',positive
'Pulled from the news but punched up to fever pitch, Sicario represents the perfect mix of cerebral and visceral thrills. Star, director and screenwriter all bring their A-game.',positive
'There\'s something refreshing about the old-fashioned way in which it entertains, a mix of silly slapstick and sight gags combined with a gentle heart.',positive
'What\'s so fascinating about the film is that it truly turns on the solving of problems, and its chief solver, stuck on Mars, manages to be so funny, interesting and infallibly likable that you\'re invested in his predicament at every moment.',positive
'If the final result doesn\'t transcend emotionally in the manner of the gold standard of Boston noir, Clint Eastwood\'s Mystic River, the fault is not in the execution but the unyieldingly oppressive nature of the underlying material.',positive
'Anyone who doesn\'t have a grand time watching Shaun the Sheep Movie is suffering from a fractured funny bone that needs to be reset.',positive
'Mara and Blanchett make for an unforgettable couple in a beautiful film about longing, loss and the confusion and wonder of love.',positive
'While it\'s more technically elaborate treatment than the characters have ever received, it\'s also gentler and more eye-pleasing than any of Blue Sky\'s other features. It\'s also a neat extension of Schulz\'s style\'though, granted, no one needs to see Pig-Pen\'s permanent cloud of filth rendered more vividly.',positive
'This being a period drama, all the expected visual grandeur is present and accounted for, from Yves Belanger\'s vibrant cinematography to Odile Dicks-Mireaux\'s period-authentic costumes to Francois Seguin\'s production design.',positive
'This is ultimately a frustrating work. The Walk has everything it needs to be a modern classic, except for an understanding that when you have everything you need to make such a film, it doesn\'t need to hype itself and explain itself. It can just be.',positive
'Shaun the Sheep Movie manages to be smart, moving and hilarious without the inclusion of a single word of dialogue.',positive
'Everest gets several things right, but it fails to find a way to make the average viewer relate to the people on the mountain.',positive
'For all of its flaws, it\'s the first film since Eastern Promises that has added anything truly fresh to the old school street-level gangster story.',positive
'Buoyed by a soundtrack that\'ll have fortysomethings cracking open 40-ounces and recalling a marginally simpler, if still chaotic, time in their lives, Straight Outta Compton\'s bark is just as snarly-cool as its bite. Take that, Tipper Gore.',positive
'Blanchett makes us feel the creeping horror of professional disgrace, the fear and stigma, however unfair Mapes argues her treatment may have been. We watch a polished professional come apart at the seams, caught up in self-incrimination and spiralling neurosis.',positive
'If anything, director Cooper is so intent on portraying Bulger as a man, not a monster, the man comes off a little softer than he was, probably.',positive
'In this case, character development is neglected in favor of awe-inspiring views. There are times when we feel like we\'re on the mountain. Unfortunately, our companions - the men and women populating the screen - are never more than half-formed.',positive
'Despite Depp\'s seemingly flawless efforts, less may have been more in conveying just how bloodthirsty Bulger was. Where \'Mass\' excels is with a stellar cast whose spot on performances keep your interest as the film moves along.',positive
'Set in postwar Berlin, the story involves prostitution, black marketeering, and the death camps, and the tension between the visual style and the adult story makes the movie pretty engrossing -- it\'s an R-rated Casablanca.',positive
'Mr. Damon\'s Everyman quality (he\'s our Jimmy Stewart) helps scale the story down, but what makes this epic personal is Mr. Scott\'s filmmaking, in which every soaring aerial shot of the red planet is answered by the intimate landscape of a face.',positive
'The Peanuts Movie delivers genuine happiness with the door left open for woe.',positive
'Unashamedly romantic and achieved with a beautifully subtle, old-fashioned elegance, it\'s a graceful coming-of-age tale ripe for awards.',positive
'The result is as grim and unyielding a depiction of the Holocaust as has yet been made on that cinematically overworked subject \' a masterful exercise in narrative deprivation and sensory overload that recasts familiar horrors in daringly existential terms.',positive
'A snapshot of what happened at a particular time and place and doesn\'t try to glamorize its subjects or make any larger points about what it all means. By refusing to do so, by celebrating the process over the outcome and the work over the reward, it becomes a special experience, a movie that matters.',positive
'Ultimately, though, it\'s Abbott\'s show to steal \' and steal it he does \' as he rivetingly conjures a character who\'s chaotically charismatic, hugely affecting and for better or worse thoroughly real.',positive
'To say Blanchett is good here is a grave understatement.',positive
'While there are a few loose ends in Drew Goddard\'s screenplay, which is faithful to but necessarily less detailed than its source, the film is a triumph of storytelling, a tribute to the power of the crowd-pleaser.',positive
'Each set piece is orchestrated with aplomb - a raid on a tunnel under the border being a particular stand out - but Sicario is kept grounded in reality. Villeneuve keeps his focus tight on his small group of characters and though the plot is complex, it fits the Byzantine intricacies of the problem and the obscure motivations of the operators.',positive
'When James White really digs in, it\'s an affecting portrait of grief and of feeling lost in life.',positive
'In Date Movie, the hormones, anxiety, and princess jealousy that fuel the majority of Hollywood love stories are made so excessive that the romance itself is revealed to be...every bit as big a crock as it usually is.',positive
'Working from a screenplay by Jason Fuchs, director Joe Wright seems overwhelmed by the material, and he fails to make us care about any of the characters.',positive
'From the company that gave us \'Chicken Run\' and \'Wallace and Gromit,\' this adorable tale about a sheep who leads his comrades on a big-city adventure is some of the most pure visual storytelling you\'re going to see this year.',positive
'This is a film of tactile decadence, such a rich sensory experience that it\'s almost suffocating.',positive
'Within the vigorous entertainment of Straight Outta Compton is a sharp-minded realism about the machines within the machines, the amplifiers of money and media that, behind the scenes and offscreen, play crucial roles in the flow of power.',positive
'In the best scene, which comes late in the film, James holds his dying mother and shares a vision of their future that they both know she\'ll never get to see.',positive
'With its perilous central premise and gallery of individuals some of whom are destined not to make it, you could say Everest is a disaster movie in the old Hollywood sense of the term, but it doesn\'t feel like one. And that\'s a good thing.',positive
'Inspiring stuff, the stuff of Hollywood all the way back to Frank Capra and before: a story of scrappy underdogs, determined to get to the truth, and toppling the mighty in the process.',positive
'It\'s both soaringly romantic and truly sad.',positive
'Spotlight doesn\'t call attention to itself. Its screenplay is self-effacing, its accomplished direction is intentionally low key, and it encourages its fistful of top actors to blend into an eloquent ensemble.',positive
'In the end, The Walk finds a graceful way to pay tribute not only to Petit\'s bravery and determination \' but to the thousands lost on 9/11 in the buildings this daredevil loved so much.',positive
'Korm\'kur creates such a convincing world \' the craft of this film is astonishing \' that you\'re willing to forgive its less delicate touches in favour of its totally compelling depiction of what it must be like to ascend into a place that\'s heaven one moment and hell the very next.',positive
'Full of non-stop action, an intriguing new take on J.M. Barrie\'s classic \'Peter Pan\' tale and some old-fashioned, swashbuckling mischief led by Hugh Jackman, director Joe Wright\'s Pan is one heck of a charming romp.',positive
'Pixar might have uncovered the mysteries of our brains with \'Inside Out.\' But Aardman knows its way around our funny bones.',positive
'Harnessing the wizardry of 3-D IMAX to magnify the sheer transporting wonder, the you-are-there thrill of the experience, the film\'s payoff more than compensates for a lumbering setup, laden with cloying voiceover narration and strained whimsy.',positive
'The movie is a world-class winner.',positive
'Maybe an hour would have been enough, but even the slower patches have charm to burn.',positive
'Passable adventure that offers the occasional flash of real cleverness.',positive
'If you\'re yearning to take a sentimental journey, Brooklyn is the perfect destination.',positive
'Straight Outta Compton, while often entertaining and dynamic, ultimately feels as if its meant to act as a kind of cinematic trophy to rest on a pedestal that celebrates not only N.W.A., but the successful and trailblazing members who helped define hip hop outside of the group.',positive
'This Pan is loud, colourful, busy and full of ideas. Not all those ideas work in sync \' but most are bold and some are winningly eccentric.',positive
'Cynthia Nixon commits wholly to her role\'s maternal patience and scattered mental decay, but it\'s Abbott who really dominates James White.',positive
'The Green Inferno is not exactly a feel-good film, but it gets a very particular job done.',positive
'If the film is ultimately an exercise in atmosphere, it is without question a triumph on that front. The rich textures and almost tactile visuals are astonishing.',positive
'Sicario starts and ends with Blunt\'s impassioned performance (and she\'s spectacular in her final scene), but it\'s Del Toro who is the real standout.',positive
'The wonder of stop-motion is the mountain of effort required to achieve even the smallest movement. The charm of Shaun the Sheep is that you don\'t notice it for a moment.',positive
'In a bold move that pays off, the movie jettisons dialogue altogether and tells its whole story through barn-animal noises, goofy sound effects, and sight gags so silly they\'d make Benny Hill spin in sped-up ecstasy. The effect is contagiously cute.',positive
'While Dirty Weekend may not quite live up to its title and is certainly his least tart effort to date, the film\'s milder flavor and less acidic aftertaste is mostly a pleasurable switchup.',positive
'An entertaining combination of humor and tenderness, The Peanuts Movie isn\'t just an all-ages crowd-pleaser. It\'s the perfect first feature film for a preschooler.',positive
'As commercial entertainment, The Martian delivers on expectations of a smart blockbuster even as it adheres to the formula of a relatively simple feel-good drama. Though Interstellar aimed for more ambition, The Martian plays it safer: It\'s a brainy studio effort that sticks to familiar ground in more ways than one.',positive
'With just a little bit more prodding and elaboration, the movie could have been rich and evocative. Even if you don\'t believe what he preaches, the movie (at least) could have bordered on a transcendent experience. As it stands, it\'s pretty good, but not exactly heavenly.',positive
'Here\'s the thing about Crimson Peak, which is lurid and ghastly and immensely enjoyable and frequently spectacular and also thinner and less substantial than it wants to be, like a meal eaten in a dream.',positive
'Now in middle age, members of N.W.A. no longer believe all of the hype. They\'re in an introspective space, to the great benefit of this film.',positive
'By any standards, this would be an outstanding film, but for a debut it is remarkable.',positive
'Despite Straight Outta Compton\'s energetic acting and Gray\'s capture of in-studio Eureka! moments, it never manages to transcend biopic hagiography, with characters whose names appear in the production credits \' Dre, Cube and Eazy-E\'s widow Tomica Woods-Wright \' faring best onscreen.',positive
'A marvelous technical achievement when the director finally gets around to it.',positive
'Mr. Redford doesn\'t look like Dan Rather, but displays the same dedication to \' and respect for \' journalism that he brought to the role of Bob Woodward in All the President\'s Men.',positive
'A ghost story in which superior camerawork, costumes and production design work together to put the audience in a trance. It\'s tough on actors not to get swallowed up in the scenery.',positive
'People have spoken about how understated and old-fashioned Brooklyn is, to the extent that it might come across as a pleasant innocuous entertainment. Don\'t be fooled. Brooklyn is not toothless. But it is big-hearted, romantic and beautiful.',positive
'The movie, shot in lovely, grainy 16mm by cinematographer Ed Lachman, is so elegantly staged you can practically smell the characters\' perfume. Haynes\' direction is methodical and precise without being fussy or oppressive. Every detail has been weighed and considered.',positive
'A beautiful entity, near flawless in design, any talk of accolades certainly seems justified.',positive
'Ice-cold. Dead eyes. Demonic laugh. His face a mask you can\'t read until he\'s up in yours. Then run. That\'s Johnny Depp giving everything he\'s got in a riveting, rattlesnake performance as South Boston gangster James Whitey Bulger in Black Mass.',positive
'Abbott (\'A Most Violent Year,\' HBO\'s \'Girls\') is a revelation, creating a multidimensional character whose battling, sometimes uncontrollable emotions are clear in his warm and expressive eyes.',positive
'The animating humanism of Scott\'s film is irreducible. It\'s a wry tribute to the qualities that got our species into space in the first place: our resourcefulness, our curiosity and our outsized, ridiculous, beautiful brains.',positive
'Sicario calls to mind the films of the 1970s \' not necessarily the ones we think of as capital-I Important, but the seamy, sweaty thrillers that subtly slipped in anti-establishmentarian messages amid the violence. It mixes arthouse and grindhouse into a most satisfying cocktail.',positive
'Zemeckis is a master of using effects, but his films sometimes don\'t live up to them.... The Walk is different. The use of 3D, in particular, is so astonishing it practically wipes your memory of the silliness going on in France as Petit was learning his trade. Once Petit is on the wire, he is free, and the liberation is contagious.',positive
'Everest may disappoint those looking for a more awe-inspiring film with big vistas and jaw-dropping stunts and acts of surreal heroism. Unlike many mountain-disaster stories, this is the kind that makes you never want to look at a mountain again.',positive
'Brooklyn showcases a number of appealing ingredients, but ultimately lacks an adequate story to prop them up.',positive
'No need to bury the lede: Spotlight is a masterpiece.',positive
'Carol is a film you want to reach out and touch, if only you could reach anywhere near the top of the pedestal it\'s perched on. It is itself an unattainable love object, the goddess Venus disguised as a movie.',positive
'Failure hovers over the film as much as it did in Schulz\'s comic strip, infusing even its most ebullient set pieces and designs with a sense of melancholy.',positive
'The Good German, Steven Soderbergh\'s film noir homage, is nearly perfect when it comes to style and tone, but it concentrates so single-mindedly on the mechanics of the narrative that it loses sight of its characters.',positive
'It\'s a well-crafted, well-paced procedural drama about a monotonous psychopath.',positive
'Utterly uneasy to watch but strikingly and confidently assembled, the film is a powerful aural and visual experience that doesn\'t quite manage to sustain itself over the course of its running time, but is a remarkable \' and remarkably intense \' experience nonetheless.',positive
'The Martian really, truly works \' not as art, necessarily, but as the sort of epic, intelligent entertainment the mainstream film industry has supposedly forgotten how to craft. All that, and the movie\'s a valentine to creative collaboration as well as an example of it. It\'s enough to make you almost grateful.',positive
'It would be swell if all of The Walk came together as beautifully as the computer effects do, but it would also be churlish not to appreciate what we do have. This film may not talk the talk, but it definitely walks the walk, and for that we are grateful.',positive
'Playful, absurd and endearingly inventive, this unstoppably amusing feature reminds us why Britain\'s Aardman Animations is a mainstay of the current cartooning golden age.',positive
'Vanderbilt, the screenwriter of Zodiac, here making his debut as a director, masters the heady pulse of high-end, high-stakes journalism.',positive
'Scott\'s sci-fi adventure is the kind of film you leave the theater itching to tell your friends to see. Like Apollo 13 and Gravity, it turns science and problem solving into an edge-of-your-seat experience.',positive
'The violence of the inter-American drug trade has served as the backdrop for any number of films for more than three decades, but few have been as powerful and superbly made as Sicario.',positive
'If Johnny Depp\'s mesmerizing performance \' a bracing return to form for the star after a series of critical and commercial misfires \' is the chief selling point of Black Mass, there is much else to recommend this sober, sprawling, deeply engrossing evocation of Bulger\'s South Boston fiefdom and his complex relationship with the FBI agent John Connolly, played with equally impressive skill by Joel Edgerton.',positive
'It\'s an unusual mix of big-picture issues, grindhouse pulp and pure, rough entertainment, bolstered by one of the better ensemble casts of the year. This movie is not, um, fussing around.',positive
'It\'s almost too ruthless an achievement for its own good, in a way. It pushes its vision to the bitter end, eschewing emotion, reflection, or intellectual framing as if banned at gunpoint from any such lapses. But these are the very dehumanising conditions Saul is dealing with, and the film\'s brave choice is to follow them to the letter.',positive
'The director and screenwriter downplay the conventional melodrama inherent in the situation in favor of emphasizing how practical problems should be addressed with rational responses rather than hysteria, knee-jerk patriotism or selfish expedience.',positive
'Scott Cooper\'s Black Mass is a big, brash, horribly watchable gangster picture taken from an extraordinary true story and conceived on familiar generic lines.',positive
'James White is never more moving than when the filmmaker shows his callow hero doing the best he can: when James helps his mom weather a particularly rough patch, for instance, with what amount to real-life bedtime stories. Imagining happy scenes he\'s pretty sure she\'ll never see \' of James all grown up.',positive
'Del Toro\'s predictably impeccable production design and tonal flourishes help bring the film to life, aided by strong performances from his leads, especially Jessica Chastain, who gives the otherwise reverent proceedings just the right amount of jolt.',positive
'A beautifully murky, hard-edged thriller. Quite simply, one of the best films of the year.',positive
'Wright\'s best film so far, livelier and more disloyal to its source than \'Atonement\' or \'Pride and Prejudice\' \' crams without a care. The outcome is that increasing rarity, a proper children\'s film; even the tears are well earned.',positive
'The lack of dialogue makes Shaun The Sheep easy for younger children all over the world to understand, and the film is undeniably intended for that demographic.',positive
'Compelling and powerfully acted, with just enough wrinkles to avoid the ghosts of gangster movies past. Depp\'s appearance might distract some, but it\'s good to see him back in the groove.',positive
'Under Haynes\' sure hand, Blanchett and Mara deliver a love story to melt to. Every glance means something, no strain shows: it\'s filmmaking as natural as breathing.',positive
'A solid piece of filmmaking, from subtle beginning to the excessive end.',positive
'Made of crystal and suppressed tears, shot eternally through windows and mirrors and half-closed doors, Todd Haynes\' Carol is a love story that starts at a trickle, swells gradually to a torrent, and finally bursts the banks of your heart. A beautiful film in every way, immaculately made, and featuring two pristine actresses glowing across rooms and tousled bedclothes at each other like beacons of tentative, unspoken hope.',positive
'Ridley Scott\'s The Martian is a brainy blockbuster, melding genuine science and fiction into a rare popcorn epic that actually makes you feel smarter for watching.',positive
'Sicario doesn\'t fall apart in its second half, exactly, but it does settle for less than it should.',positive
'Amazing to look at, amazing to listen to, yet just a bit underwhelming to really think about, Sicario Denis Villeneuve\'s Mexican drug cartel drama is superlatively strong in every conceivable way except story.',positive
'It\'s overlong and sanitized but succeeds in presenting an important part of contemporary American culture to a mainstream audience.',positive
'It\'s not surprising that Truth takes the perspective that it does \' you don\'t cast Cate Blanchett and Robert Redford as Mapes and Rather and not expect the film to side with them.',positive
'Spotlight one of the best movies about journalism ever made, at once gripping and accurate. It doesn\'t just get the big things right, such as how news stories evolve, but the small things, such as what offices look like and how staff tends to react to a new boss.',positive
'This is a sweet, funny, smart, genuine all-ages movie with simple, timeless messages.',positive
'For those who want to feel like they\'re 110 stories up and living in the clouds, Hollywood does its job conjuring movie magic with a breathtaking Walk to remember.',positive
'It\'s an uncommonly bold gambit, expressly designed to frustrate people who want to see a strong woman deliver a righteous ass kicking. The progressivism here is instead rooted in futility and despair, which provides much more of a valuable shock to the system.',positive
'Short, sweet, charming and often very funny, Shaun the Sheep Movie has essentially no intelligible dialogue and doesn\'t need any.',positive
'It\'s one of the most comforting science fiction films in years.',positive
'It\'s biopic syndrome, this impulse to condense events to hit the high notes, to provide fans with recognizable stories, to essentially act as a greatest hits album, and it sinks the second half of an otherwise compelling, funny and extremely entertaining film with a beat all its own.',positive
'Frequently very funny, undeniably aimed at younger audiences, and true to the source material, The Peanuts Movie is too mild-mannered to win over brand new audiences, but it\'s going to please people who were already fond of the underlying property, and it should be a big nostalgia-driven hit for the studio.',positive
'The Peanuts Movie may be simultaneously the most charming and the most daring experiment in human genetics ever conducted. At issue is whether the character summaries and back stories of fictional pop-culture figures can be passed from one generation to the next solely through DNA.',positive
'What\'s being marketed as a sober, straightforward sci-fi drama (the words \'Bring him home\' superimposed on an unsmiling Matt Damon inside a space helmet) is instead a smart, exhilarating, often disarmingly funny return to classic adventures of yore.',positive
'Straight Outta Compton is, undoubtedly, a nostalgia trip, but, this being NWA, it\'s one you take in a \'64 Impala with height-adjustable suspension. It\'s a loud, stylish ride.',positive
'It all adds up to a terrific, if biased on the side of the winners (Dre and Cube) history lesson, and a thoroughly compelling, very American and utterly modern musical biography.',positive
'The Walk, in its last half at least, is a dazzling piece of work, particularly in 3-D; even so, its most luminous effect is an actor.',positive
'If at any point in Sicario, you feel lost, don\'t worry about it. The movie is all about being lost and, in any case, all becomes clear, eventually.',positive
'Ronan, who\'s made a habit of giving us sparkling turns since she was a kid in 2007\'s Atonement, delivers a dazzlingly mature performance.',positive
'Ronan is Brooklyn\'s linchpin, and its saving grace.',positive
'In order to make the walk, and in order for it to matter to him, Philippe Petit has to comprehend it as real and impossible. Zemeckis teaches us the same lesson.',positive
'I wish the film had done more \' anything \' to analyze Petit\'s psyche. But he barely exists in the movie except as a certified daredevil.',positive
'Besides the movie\'s weight in our contemporary, post-Ferguson historical moment, Straight Outta Compton may also be the funniest, most exhilarating and flat-out best Hollywood movie of the summer.',positive
'It feels less like an cautionary adventure movie or the classy Hollywood equivalent of a Reader\'s Digest Drama in Real Life and much more like a disaster epic.',positive
'The problem \' not fatal \' with The Walk is that the narrative wire droops between the movie\'s opening and final sequences.',positive
'This is a love letter to lunacy (and an unspoken tribute to the iconic towers) that lets you feel what it\'s like to tread where only gods dare.',positive
'Without an emotional core, a stronger sociological angle, or many visceral thrills, Black Mass more or less limits itself to procedural status. Within those aims, it\'s a pretty good one, absorbing and well-made.',positive
'Sicario, which combines dizzying action scenes with a taut script, ravishing photography and an otherwordly musical score, is a knockout.',positive
'The film, as entertaining as it is, doesn\'t exactly further a genre that has been stale since the success of 2013 rom-zom-com Warm Bodies.... What\'s promising about Scouts Guide, though, are its unlikely heroes.',positive
'Director/screenwriter Khalil Sullins makes an auspicious feature debut with his audacious sci-fi thriller that\'s as engrossing as it is thought-provoking.',positive
'In terms of filmmaking prowess, remarkable may not do Laszlo Nemes\' holocaust drama Son of Saul justice.',positive
'Haynes understands that swooningly beautiful traditional technique bolstered by thrilling performances creates the greatest impact. He has made a serious melodrama about the geometry of desire, a dreamy example of heightened reality that fully engages emotions despite the exact calculations with which it\'s been made.',positive
'It\'s the best film McCarthy has ever made: restrained, intelligent and grown-up, but unfolding with the pacing and rhythm of a thriller.',positive
'He\'s good, but Depp can\'t quite annihilate the self-consciousness that makes some of his more light-hearted work shine. Too often, it feels like he\'s channeling other actors: here he\'s Jack Nicholson with Hunter S. Thompson\'s nose, there he\'s an Irish-American Ray Liotta.',positive
'Perhaps most importantly, not only does the film stress the importance of using math and physics and botany and chemistry to solve problems, but it also makes a plot based on scientific inquiry and audacity just as exciting and even more unpredictable as the movies\' usual brand of problem-solving, the kind that involves punching everyone and then blowing everything up.',positive
'Sumptuous, clever and cold.',positive
'Peanuts is all about simplicity, and what the plot lacks in nuance and complexity is made up for with relatable characters whom people have spent a lifetime watching.',positive
'This is a film that believes deeply in ghosts, and half of them are in its director\'s head.',positive
'This tight, relatively low-key, step-by-step procedural has a stronger impact than any horror movie.',positive
'Truth would have been more compelling with less sanctimony and tougher self-examination.',positive
'Depp\'s instinct for observing, underlaying and keeping things in, then letting it all out when required, pays big dividends here in a performance far more convincing than his previous big gangster role, John Dillinger in Michael Mann\'s Public Enemies; it\'s unexpected, very welcome at this point in his career, and one of his best.',positive
'Haynes has calibrated the film so precisely to Blanchett\'s talents that he couldn\'t have rendered her better with animation.',positive
'Daniel Radcliffe cleans up nicely as Igor, the man behind the madman who makes the monster in this, the 60th (thereabouts) film to adapt or riff on Mary Shelley\'s prescient 1818 sci-fi/horror novel. Happily, director Paul McGuigan, working from a script by Max Landis, takes the story in some new directions by choosing to retell the tale from the perspective of the famed hunchback.',positive
'Director Baltasar Korm\'kur (\'2 Guns\') and his cast craft a lean narrative tone that humanizes the action without an excess of gloss.',positive
'This is Soderbergh\'s show, and a haunting and hypnotic show it is.',positive
'Damon is terrific. The movie lives and breathes on his performance, and he comes through in every scene.',positive
'The coolest sequences in the film are its first third, with Watney\'s communication cut off and NASA unaware he\'s there.',positive
'When Abbot and Nixon start their sparring, Mond\'s film takes on a magnificently physical and tactile quality.',positive
'We see the mistakes before the principals do. That\'s what makes the news-story-gone-wrong drama Truth so compelling.',positive
'Though this movie waltzes to its own strange rhythm, del Toro hits every note.',positive
'Brooklyn doesn\'t quite capture Brooklyn, but its ambivalence about being Irish is gloriously epic.',positive
'The overly earnest movie falls below the rich ambiguities that Keaton brings to the part, resulting in a measured drama so restrained it sometimes underserves the material. Where Birdman magnified Keaton\'s talent, Spotlight leans on it.',positive
'Lucy (Hadley Belle Miller) is still full of nickel-a-session psychotherapy, Linus still soulful enough to recognize his friend\'s heart. And Charlie\'s sister Sally (Mariel Sheets) still assumes Linus is her \'Sweet Baboo.\'',positive
'For all of its modesty and dedication to process, Spotlight winds up being a startlingly emotional experience, and not just for filmgoers with intimate knowledge of the culture it depicts.',positive
'Johnny Depp\'s broodingly psychotic turn as convicted Boston crime lord James \'Whitey\' Bulger is not the only tasty thing about Scott Cooper\'s tale of the unholy alliance between a South Boston Irish mobster and the FBI.',positive
'Guillermo del Toro\'s fussiest, most compartmentalized construction, filled with the most powerful sense of repression and delusion.',positive
'Writer/director James Vanderbilt...sticks to Mapes\' version of the truth, and the film serves as a valedictory for Mapes and Rather. Still, the movie never negates the truth\'s other strands, while also showing what a human profession journalism is.',positive
'As with other Aardman productions, the greatest delights derive from relishing the details of the clay figures and intricate sets, crafted by the studio\'s master model builders.',positive
'In the spirit of so many films created for the small screen, My All American works way too hard to make sure our heartstrings are pulled \' and actually yanked hard from start to finish.',positive
'The film, directed with exceptional flair and elegant concision by Scott Cooper, even comes from Warner Bros., the studio that specialized in psychopathic monsters played by such stars as James Cagney and Edward G. Robinson during Hollywood\'s golden age.',positive
'One of the reasons that Spotlight is so deeply, absurdly satisfying to this newspaper writer \' is that Tom McCarthy\'s movie doesn\'t turn its journalists into heroes. It just lets them do their jobs, as tedious and critical as those are, with a realism that grips an audience almost in spite of itself.',positive
'When the songs themselves take center stage the movie works. What remains in the wings constitutes another, fuller story.',positive
'The dark nihilism of Sicario masks a reliance on easier solutions, ones we\'ve been fed by decades of genre films and that feed our need for justice dispensed with violent, vengeful directness. The movie promises to clear the fetid air around the drug wars. In the end it\'s just another drug.',positive
'It can\'t develop themes because it\'s too busy disseminating information, and this extends to its main characters.',positive
'Brooklyn is that rare period drama that doesn\'t lose itself in its dogged re-creation of another time.',positive
'Initially amusing but finally sour sex comedy.',positive
'As a celebration of agility, ability, and outlandish human behavior, The Walk is a winning thing. It may not get inside the head of its pole-balancing protagonist - it doesn\'t really even try - but Zemeckis\' movie takes you skyward.',positive
'Spotlight is not about fiery performances or thrilling set-pieces \' it\'s simply a tight and captivating look at professionals who excel at their jobs, and who legitimately care about making a difference. Sometimes, that\'s more than enough.',positive
'Spotlight provides a wealth of exceptional performances.',positive
'The Walk is the movie that takes us up there, gives us the jitters and makes us titter along the way.',positive
'Almost magically, The Walk transforms itself into a beguiling caper movie, full of comic energy and nimble ingenuity.',positive
'The Martian is shot, designed, computer-generated, and scripted on a level that makes most films of its ilk look slipshod. Scott and writer Drew Goddard aren\'t trying to make an \'important\' sci-fi movie like Interstellar. They aim lower but blow past their marks.',positive
'For those who know the strip well, The Peanuts Movie should feel like the first day of a new school year, reunited with a classroom full of familiar faces.',positive
'The year is not over, but I\'ve already seen my favorite film of 2015. It\'s Thomas McCarthy\'s brilliant, responsible, galvanizing and unforgettable Spotlight.',positive
'Oyelowo and Mara\'s riveting, embodied performances rise above the material.',positive
'Gestures, looks and touches carry enormous weight, and Blanchett and Mara, both excellent, invite micropscopic readings of their every glance and movement.',positive
'Truth is a movie curiously in conflict with itself. There is a constant shift between granular detail and big-picture sweep that the movie never fully resolves.',positive
'This movie is so raw and depressing that in one brutal scene Ms. Connelly is so desperate for a fix that she injects a hypodermic needle into her vagina. Don\'t say I didn\'t warn you.',positive
'Familiar in its general trajectory, but unusually raw and ragged in its emotional architecture, Mond\'s fraught portrait of a mother and son in crisis sports a pair of knockout performances by Cynthia Nixon and \'Girls\' alumnus Christopher Abbott.',positive
'It\'s not easy to make a movie as beautiful as Brooklyn, where the stakes are low but the outcome really matters. This is an old-fashioned entertainment, but one so masterfully crafted and heartfelt that it\'s hard not to love.',positive
'This suspenseful survival tale, smartass to its core, slaps a smile on your face that you\'ll wear all the way home.',positive
'Never entirely satisfying as a drama, Crimson Peak is visually dazzling, boasting lively and at times even transfixing performances that keep the story\'s blood flowing.',positive
'Yes, The Martian does look like it was shot on Mars, even though the film\'s tone is suspiciously light and cheerful for Scott, who tends to thrive on a chillier, more dour habitat.',positive
'More than most docudramas about fairly recent events, it is so well written and acted that it conveys a convincing illusion of veracity.',positive
'Crimson Peak\'s atmosphere crackles with sexual passion and dark secrets. There are a couple of monsters (supernatural and human), but the gigantic emotions are the most terrifying thing onscreen.',positive
'The Martian is a straightforward and thrilling survival-and-rescue adventure, without the metaphysical and emotional trappings of, say, \'Interstellar.\'\' It\'s pure fun.',positive
'It\'s not easy to make an emotionally involving film in which some of the most pivotal moments are about phone calls and making copies of documents and a source circling names on a document \' but save for a few overly dry moments, Spotlight prevails.',positive
'The film is a casting coup, with Blanchett\'s inherent languor \'plus that low drawl of hers, a breath away from boredom \' played off against the perter intelligence of Mara, whose manner, as always, is caught between the alien and the avian.',positive
'Some movies are so good and true and tough-to-the-core they should just sneak up on you. James White is one of them.',positive
'This is a good, solid, well-executed crime story. Nothing more, nothing less.',positive
'Chastain and Wasikowska take center stage while Hiddleston flutters around like one of Allerdale\'s huge black moths. Watching the women square off within del Toro\'s eye-popping, painterly palette is a feast for the eyes, if not particularly substantial fare for the mind.',positive
'Son of a Gun becomes a somewhat predictable but excitingly twisty heist film involving a double-dealing Russian heavy, a desperate femme fatale, and a fortune in gold bars. It has just enough muscle and style to make the familiar feel fresh.',positive
'The Martian is a film that respects the geekiest among us, and that pays off all around.',positive
'All involved bring a warm eccentricity that lifts what in lesser hands could be a collection of cliches about the contrasts between the Old World and the New.',positive
'With a taut and timely screenplay by Taylor Sheridan, Sicario is a brilliant action thriller with the smarts of a message movie.',positive
'Mond\'s film doesn\'t feature traditional structure or many familiar character beats of self-improvement, but as a visceral, in-the-moment portrait of struggle and suffering, it\'s a striking first film.',positive
'What keeps Sicario from cynicism is the nature and depth of Villeneuve\'s gaze, not childishly wide-eyed but capable still of feeling pain. He\'s a terrific director. You know that if his heroine, Alice, gets out of Cartel-land alive, she might spend a few months in an asylum, but she\'ll be back, hell-bent on seizing the foreground.',positive
'Gorgeously photographed, sensitively written and directed, flawlessly acted, and deeply, intensely important, Carol is Todd Haynes\' most brilliant film since Far From Heaven and one of the triumphs of 2015.',positive
'Director and co-writer Tom McCarthy played a weasel of a journalist in The Wire. Now he has made a meticulous, exacting procedural on real-life journalists who excelled at their job; had the resources to do it properly; and in early 2002, published the first in a Pulitzer Prize-winning series of grim, carefully detailed stories of pedophile priests.',positive
'While highly entertaining and sometimes inspired, Black Mass is more like Scorsese lite. In perhaps the most memorable sequence, Bulger sardonically tests a childhood friend (Joel Edgerton) for loyalty by teasing out a \'secret\' steak sauce in what\'s basically a reworking/homage of Joe Pesci\'s famous \'I\'m funny, how?\' scene in \'GoodFellas.\'',positive
'Though Villeneuve magnifies the pervasive dread surrounding the modern drug war, he\'s better at conveying the thrill of creeping through that battlefield than the complex set of interests sustaining it.',positive
'A gorgeous film that could inspire a whole new crop of astronauts.',positive
'In the closing act, the film sharpens and becomes something far more compelling.',positive
'As a movie, Black Mass often drowns its dramatic potential in a dreary atmosphere and grisly violence used to dubious effect. Depp, however, operates on another level.',positive
'Like so many films consumed with the minutiae of daily journalism, Spotlight is a magnificently nerdy process movie \' a tour de force of filing-cabinet cinema, made with absolute assurance that we\'ll be held by scene after scene of people talking, taking notes, following tips, hounding sources, poring over records, filling out spreadsheets, and having one door after another slammed in their faces.',positive
'With Spotlight, we get a reminder of the vital importance of an independent, professional press to any community.',positive
'Anomalisa is an extraordinarily wise film about the reasons we turn to other people and the enormous difficulty of doing so.',positive
'It has enough ingredients for a reasonably entertaining fantasy adventure\'except, that is, for an interesting lead character with an emotionally compelling hook.',positive
'The Martian is nearly all things to all audiences: a ticking-clock drama, an intimate character study, a sci-fi comedy, a rollicking space adventure. It\'s almost impossible to dislike, which is perhaps its only flaw. When a huge film reveals its eager-to-please intentions from the get-go, the stakes evaporate awfully quick.',positive
'Guillermo del Toro\'s gothic fantasy-romance Crimson Peak is outrageously sumptuous, gruesomely violent and designed to within an inch of its life.',positive
'The \'banality of evil\' was never so hypocritical, so banal and so evil.',positive
'This is Depp\'s show all the way, featuring his best dramatic performance since another organized-crime movie, 1997\'s \'Donnie Brasco.\'',positive
'Carol is often about its surfaces, their beauty contrasting with the scary duality of people, relationships. The surfaces in Carol are so seductive that one understands the ache to belong in that world.',positive
'In an age of digital chaos and deep emotional themes The Peanuts Movie keeps things sweet and simple, perfectly in tune with the qualities Schulz fans adore.',positive
'The rare movie that improves as it goes along, shedding its cliches and getting down to what matters.',positive
'It may be a little overwrought for some tastes, borderline camp at points, but if you\'re partial to a bit of Victorian romance with Hammer horror gloop and big, frilly night-gowns, GDT delivers an uncommon treat.',positive
'It doesn\'t always seem to know what it wants to be. But it\'s still full of marvels.',positive
'A delightful romp that captures the spirit of the adored 65-year-old comic strip.',positive
'By modeling its structure so closely after All the President\'s Men, Spotlight only draws closer attention to its lack of scope and ambition.',positive
'The acting in Black Mass is tremendous.',positive
'Kaufman and Johnson tease out the possible causes and effects of Michael\'s crisis with great imagination, tilting your sympathies so subtly as they do so that you don\'t even feel it going on.',positive
'The director Todd Haynes and the novelist Patricia Highsmith fit together like a hand and glove - a beautifully manicured hand and a sleek gray-green leather glove, two images that figure prominently in Carol.',positive
'Clocking in at a slim 85 minutes, the whole thing flies by quite pleasingly, a warm and funny feature that reasserts the value of high quality visuals and attention to detail.',positive
'It uses convention to its advantage through an intriguing play with casting choices and bizarrely effective allusions to film history.',positive
'Guillermo del Toro\'s latest dive into the darkness is a sumptuous, beautifully constructed tale that feels both archaic and inviting.',positive
'This is one of the better musical biopics of the last 20 years.',positive
'If you strip away all the gunplay, Hitman: Agent 47 would be about 10 minutes long.',positive
'The Martian is never less than engaging, and often much more than that.',positive
'Sicario is an ambush, a low-slung film about a dirty drugs war with Mexico which challenges and engages in equal measure. It moves with grim tenacity, confounding expectations until its very final sequence.',positive
'Spotlight feels both timeless and modern, a dexterously crafted film that could have been made anytime but somehow feels perfect for right now.',positive
'You\'ve seen neo-noirs like this before, but you probably haven\'t had this much fun with a modern B movie in a while.',positive
'Brooklyn endows its characters with desires and aspirations, but not with foresight, and it examines the past with open-minded curiosity rather than with sentimentality or easy judgment.',positive
'One of the summer\'s most entertaining and provocative movies.',positive
'To turn a spotlight fittingly on Spotlight, it\'s the year\'s best movie so far, and a rarity among countless dramatizations that claim to be based on actual events. In this one the events ring consistently \' and dramatically \' true.',positive
'Every scene of calm, potentially, is trip-wired for an explosion. But for all its chilling tension and horrific imagery, Sicario is also a beautiful movie.',positive
'Gradually the film turns its very specific story of one immigrant into a moving group portrait.',positive
'It has generous lashings of Aardman Animations\' trademark warmth, visual inventiveness, and satisfying Claymation tactility.',positive
'For all the dogged journalism and righteous indignation in the film, it\'s this sense of intimacy, of community, of betrayal and misdirected allegiances \' it was the Church, after all \' that keeps the film from reveling too much in victory or triumph. That, in turn, makes it an emotional tour de force.',positive
'Somehow, this Peanuts feels familiar, even cozy. I can\'t make any great claims for it, but it feels like the return of an old friend.',positive
'Rather than a birds\'-eye procedural about a complex international mission, it\'s a close-up of that mission from the point of view of the participant who understands it the least.',positive
'The performances are terrific, and when it\'s on its game, which is often, Straight Outta Compton is an explosive look at the creation of a message that had to be delivered by the only people who could deliver it, a message that is, unfortunately, as timely now as when we first heard it.',positive
'If you think they don\'t make movies like they used to, Brooklyn is glorious proof to the contrary.',positive
'It plays out all the usual tropes of the investigative-journalism genre \' the hot tips, the clandestine meetings, the hand-wringing about ethics, etc. \' without adding a jot of novelty.',positive
'Engrossing and occasionally moving, it doesn\'t electrify like that other film about the press taking on a chief executive, Alan Pakula\'s \'All the President\'s Men\' (1976).',positive
'A kind of mad coming-of-age yarn embellished with lightning bolts and monsters made of cadaverous flesh.',positive
'Although not without moments of sadness and tragedy, Brooklyn is sublimely uplifting and life affirming.',positive
'It\'s the sweet sincerity of Brooklyn that stamps it as both refreshing and nostalgic. The film is as welcome as a photo you just discovered of your mother before you were born, in which she looks prettier than you ever imagined.',positive
'In a movie culture with near-inescapable CGI, old-fashioned animation like Shaun the Sheep is always a treat \' and a romp this ambitiously aimless is an all-too-rare marvel.',positive
'While the digital effects are undeniably contemporary, Crimson Peak is otherwise a period homage that mostly plays like a period film, rarely giving in to contemporary notions of pacing and payoff. When the scares do arrive, however, they\'re effectively unsettling.',positive
'It\'s tempting to think Hitman undermines any beauty it musters with its habit of ridiculousness.',positive
'If the movie pushes most of the ugliest behavior off onto side players (like the notorious Suge Knight, played by R. Marcus Taylor), it does for the most part fulfill its mission, breathing life into the origin story of a group whose influence is still being felt.',positive
'Potent and visceral in its depiction of street life and blinged-up excess alike, Straight Outta Compton delivers big beats of both kinds.',positive
'Blanchett makes an indelible impression as a woman who, through breeding, intense personal cultivation and social expectations, has brilliantly mastered the skill of navigating through life.',positive
'Like Far From Heaven, Carol mines society\'s narrow-mindedness and the dangers of living a double life. But what was true more than a half century ago remains true now: The heart wants what it wants, society and propriety be damned.',positive
'Here\'s what\'s good about The Good German: The look is fantastic; technically, the movie is a retro marvel. Here\'s what\'s bad: The script sucks; it keeps promising to be clever, engaging, subtle and completely fails to deliver.',positive
'Without Ronan\'s performance, Brooklyn might have left a sugary taste. But she is the ingredient that brings everything together: her calm poise anchors almost every scene and every shot.',positive
'McCarthy and his brilliant cast make hard work and truth-telling inspiring.',positive
'There is no tragic hero here; there is no overarching explanation, but a movie that offered either of those would seem pretty pat. Take it or leave, Everest is just there.',positive
'By necessity, Black Mass begins in a hole it can never dig out of. It\'s the portrait of a monster told in a flat line.',positive
'It\'s a solid if not stellar crime drama, well put together, very well acted, and lacking only a genuine reason to exist.',positive
'But for all the profane language and sexual frankness, Soderbergh\'s film is no more cynical or world-weary than its inspirations, and in the end, it feels like a clever trick wrapped around a hollow center.',positive
'This is sweet, sentimental filmmaking of the old school, but it\'s too sincere to get sticky. If \'nice\' isn\'t the kind of adjective to put you off a movie, you\'ll probably enjoy Brooklyn, even if you\'re occasionally aware of its masterful manipulations.',positive
'While Clooney and especially Blanchett give solid performances, and McGuire plays effectively against type, the movie is best appreciated as an exercise in vintage Hollywood style.',positive
'The leisure-time viewer will say, \'\'Hey, this is sort of like Casablanca, so why play it again?\'\'',positive
'Working from a script co-written with Christopher Browne, director Robert Zemeckis (\'Forrest Gump\') pulls off a fabulous trick of his own: delivering a mainstream entertainment that has, at its heart, a poetic sensibility.',positive
'As a dramatic thriller, Black Mass has trouble getting into low orbit. There are some tremendous scenes but the narrative as a whole feels more like a chronology of dastardly dealings than the epic tale of a criminal\'s rise and fall.',positive
'Zemeckis reminds us that it\'s in the service of reality, rather than fantasy, that digital technology is often most potent.',positive
'Though the women could be stronger and the accents occasionally jar, cooper\'s study of moral corruption enthrals. The Johnny-ssance starts here!',positive
'Straight Outta Compton reminds viewers not only who N.W.A. were and what they meant, but also why they mattered \' and still do.',positive
'Spotlight is simply a great story exceedingly well told, through characters whose fingers are perpetually stained with ink.',positive
'The most fascinating thing about the film is how it leans into predictability rather than make a show of fighting it.',positive
'Colm T\'ib\'n\'s bitter-sweet novel of the Irish expat experience brought impeccably to the screen by Crowley and Hornby, with Saoirse Ronan excelling herself in the leaf.',positive
'Salvatore Totino\'s crisp 3D photography and Kormakur\'s way with a clear, fluid, thrilling action sequence show off the mountain in immensely impressive ways. But the humans involved get short shrift.',positive
'A godsend for audiences who hunger for rich emotion presented with wit, grace and not a trace of sentimentality, Brooklyn illustrates the power of restraint in dealing with poignant, impassioned material.',positive
'Keaton, who deserved an Oscar for his performance in \'Birdman,\' brings to Robinson a bracing blend of humor and authority. Ruffalo is the essence of the newsman who just won\'t quit, and McAdams is just as effective as his more low-key colleague.',positive
'For those who buy into the precept that good things are worth waiting for, The Walk unquestionably delivers.',positive
'Though it has a few elements of its construction that might be questionable, it\'s mostly a powerful, thoughtful, and visually striking picture.',positive
'It is a creamily sensuous, richly observed piece of work, handsomely detailed and furnished: the clothes, the hair, the automobiles, the train carriages, the record players, the lipstick and the cigarettes are all superbly presented. The combination of all this is intoxicating in itself.',positive
'Straight Outta Compton plays better when it\'s outside the box, showing us N.W.A power and the consequences of abusing it. Would the movie be better if it didn\'t sidestep the band\'s misogyny, gay-bashing and malicious infighting? No shit. But what stands is an amazement, an electrifying piece of hip-hop history that speaks urgently to right now.',positive
'Visually spectacular and consistently entertaining, Ridley Scott\'s space rescue procedural The Martian suffers only from a failure to hit its emotional beats with the amount of force and feeling usually required to make this kind of life-and-death adventure really take off.',positive
'A sensitive, dewy-eyed yet mature performance by Saoirse Ronan is the appealing centerpiece of Brooklyn.',positive
'For all its third act nuttiness, The Perfect Guy really should have gone way crazier.',positive
'Truth is a strange interpretation of events, in which the visuals and the music sometime seem to be nudging us in one direction, even as the screenplay and the performances are telling us something quite different.',positive
'Spotlight is that rare journalistic procedural that deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as \'All the President\'s Men,\' and while the movie never glamorizes or makes saints of its hard-working newsgatherers, it does stand as a reminder of the power and importance of a free press, particularly in ferreting out local corruption and malfeasance.',positive
'Cooper, the director of Crazy Heart and the underrated Out of the Furnace, has made a tight and tense gangster film with Black Mass. But it\'s a pretty straight-ahead entry in the genre, albeit one peppered with spicy performances.',positive
'The Martian celebrates both the indomitable human spirit and the belief that our species can, with patience and common sense, think its way out of almost any problem. If the film occasionally preaches, its message strikes home.',positive
'The film fulfills its limited mandate of providing fast-paced adventure and some nice eye candy without adding anything memorable to the tale of The Boy Who Can Fly.',positive
'Anomalisa is a movie with wit to burn (look out for the Sarah Brightman line and the meeting room pit) and enough incidental touches that the total achievement feels immense.',positive
'The movement of the story\'from wrenching homesickness to blooming confidence and a smile on one\'s stroll to work\'elevates the movie into universal urban poetry.',positive
'The brutalisation of three female characters is horrific, but it would be a presumptuous leap to suggest the film itself flexes a misogynistic creed. Such assertions would woefully misconstrue Bakhia\'s thematic subtext, which is an examination and comment on the male mind warped by patriarchal thinking and a manipulative form of self-exculpation/cowardice.',positive
'The Walk satisfies as an absorbing yarn of authority-flouting ad\'ven\'ture and as an example of stomach-flipping you-are-there-ness. The journey it offers viewers doesn\'t just span 140 feet, but also an ethereal, now-vanished, world.',positive
'Spotlight is a Valentine to investigative journalism and a stark reminder of where we\'re headed now that this brand of writing has become an endangered species. The film is unique in that it focuses almost entirely on the process.',positive
'The supporting cast is an embarrassment of riches for Scott, and Chastain is particularly strong as the concerned commander of the mission. Yet this is most definitely Damon\'s movie and a throwback to the unabashed idealism of Hollywood past.',positive
'There is nothing underneath the glossy surface and no real insight into what made this man tick \' and despite how creepy he looks here, Bulger was a man, not a devil.',positive
'Moviegoers may expect something sexier than what they get here, but Neil LaBute\'s focus on just-talk between Broderick and co-star Alice Eve, funny but never uproarious, provides its own modest rewards.',positive
'Brooklyn is easily the year\'s best and most beguiling love story. The surprise is that it also goes deeper, sadder and truer.',positive
'I cannot say how I\'d feel about The Walk if I\'d never seen Man on Wire, because I did see Man on Wire, and I can\'t un-see it. I love it. I can only say The Walk struck me as an honorable good try of an also-ran, though with some lovely things to offer.',positive
'As notorious gangster James \'Whitey\' Bulger, Depp astounds with one of the best performances in his long career while co-star Joel Edgerton steps up equally well as John Connolly, an ethically questionable FBI agent who flirts with the wrong side of the law.',positive
'The story works out like you might expect. The joys are in the way director Breck Eisner, like Diesel, is earnest about this goofiness. His direction might not showcase the full wit of the script, but it does honor its inventiveness.',positive
'It\'s most towering accomplishment are its set pieces, which manage to be brash, exhilarating, and even occasionally moving.',positive
'Director Guillermo del Toro\'s unique visual style is on display but the story is predictable, the characters are flat, and the supernatural elements are red herrings. To paraphrase a character, this isn\'t so much a ghost story as it is a \'story with ghosts.\'',positive
'Using techniques of distanciation that sometimes make it an alienating, even confusing experience, L\'szl\' Nemes\'s cogent, strikingly confident debut is harrowing, but cinematically rewarding.',positive
'A remarkable refashioning of the Holocaust drama that reignites the setting with extraordinary immediacy, Son of Saul is both terrifying to watch and too gripping in its moment-to-moment to look away.',positive
'The Aardman vision of contemporary England is generous, inclusive and - if a fast-moving film about a smart-alec sheep can allow itself such grandiose ambitions \' genuinely inspiring.',positive
'Like in so many silents, the plot is joyously minimal.',positive
'Villeneuve (Prisoners, Incendies) once again proves he can craft a gripping tale that never collapses under its own moral weight. Sicario is not an easy film to watch, but it is a riveting and essential one.',positive
'This delightful stop-motion animated romp features no dialogue, which is as it should be \' the beauty of animals is in their actions, not words, after all.',positive
'Denis Villeneuve\'s film views life in the age of the modern-day drug war as an ever-crescendoing existential nightmare.',positive
'If The Peanuts Movie never quite reaches the melancholy of earlier films like \'A Boy Named Charlie Brown\' and \'Snoopy Come Home,\' it nonetheless respects the importance of failure and disappointment that Schulz always included in his storytelling.',positive
'It takes a genuine master craftsman to take something as complex and difficult as this and make it look easy, but it also takes an artist with a great ear to take something as dense with exposition as this is and make it practically sing.',positive
'Like a great amusement park ride, Shaun the Sheep Movie is consistently enjoyable.',positive
'Director Tom McCarthy, who wrote the script with Josh Singer, has made a film without heroes.',positive
'One of its major virtues is what\'s not there: no creepy flashbacks of prowling priests, or \' as in the prelude to Clint Eastwood\'s \'Mystic River\' \' of children in the vortex of peril. Everything happens in the here and now, not least the recitation of the there and then.',positive
'Both haunting and sweeping, Carol represents another masterwork from one of this generation\'s great filmmakers.',positive
'Even with the film\'s mild flaws and arms-wide-open approach, it tells a powerful, engaging and compelling story of how America challenged and changed five young black men, and how they in turn challenged and changed America.',positive
'Its abrasive portrait of contemporary New York as a place of noise and nerve-rattling turmoil captures the mood of the city more accurately than any recent film I can think of. And the jagged camera work exacerbates the film\'s jarring sense of immediacy.',positive
'Del Toro reminds us just how chilling bumping into the supernatural is supposed to be, just how stomach churning violence is and just how many shades of red blood shows us, from first spurt to crusty dust.',positive
'It lacks the same constant surprises of last year\'s Gravity or the visual poetry of Mad Max: Fury Road, but Korm\'kur\'s movie nonetheless marks the rare fusion of effective craftsmanship with focused storytelling.',positive
'McGuigan\'s visually vivid Victor Frankenstein races to its lightning-storm finish, running over the solid (if not electrifying) acting of McAvoy and Radcliffe.',positive
'For the two hours it lasted I wasn\'t asking any questions, only giggling, squirming, screaming, and swooning.',positive
'This is a movie you feel deeply in the pit of your stomach. Sometimes, it literally hurts to watch it.',positive
'There\'s a resemblance here to both the story and the movie adaptation of the story told in \'The Perfect Storm.\' The characters involved are making a good faith effort\'but good faith efforts by humans can only go so far.',positive
'More interesting than the hows and whys of N.W.A.\'s controversial rise and fall in the industry are the inside snapshots of the industry itself, from grimy Compton clubs to electrifying arena concerts to hotel orgies to studio sessions that illuminate Dr. Dre\'s creative process.',positive
'Blunt\'s performance has an edge of steel. She brings off a mix of confidence, bewilderment and vulnerability, which functions very well against the alpha male characters higher up the chain of command.',positive
'The efforts to stay true to the spirit of Schulz are worth a happy dance for kids and adults alike.',positive
'Entertaining as the movie often is, this all-American, can-do attitude is also the source of its shortcomings. Given the enormousness of its subject, there is a radical lack of awe in this movie.',positive
'Bringing optimism, nerd-itude and a touch of crazy to his character\'s solo ordeal\'at one point, scraggly Watney calls himself a \'space pirate\'\'Damon is the key to the movie\'s exuberance.',positive
'Mond\'s skill at working with actors is equal to his fully developed visual style and assured modulation of atmosphere and tone. This may be a small movie, but it\'s an impressively rigorous one without an ounce of flab.',positive
'An admirable attempt at presenting a difficult subject that suffers from an eventual pileup of melodramatic happenstances.',positive
'Brooklyn often feels like a throwback in the best way, while Ronan has an old-time star turn, and she makes the most of it.',positive
'It\'s really a movie about love at first sight, about the dizzying early days of a relationship, about a passion so strong it can\'t be described, or denied. And that\'s something everyone can identify with. If they\'re lucky.',positive
'The casting is perfect and the acting uniformly superb. For all its lack of depth, the script is sharp, zippy and only occasionally hokey.',positive
'Part IMAX nature documentary and part Hollywood disaster movie, it does an effective job of conveying what it\'s like to climb the mountain, the hours and days spent acclimating on practice hikes, and the punishing physical effects that accompany each subsequent change of altitude.',positive
'Like any creative endeavor a film is the sum of its parts. In the most elementary terms it needs a screenplay as a base, a cast to bring the script to life and a director to orchestrate the pieces into something of considerable impact. Excuse the hyperbole, but Tom McCarthy\'s Spotlight is an example of when all those pieces fit together almost perfectly.',positive
'Haynes never lifts Carol above over-dressed melodrama. And with every perfect bar where every perfect martini is served, every perfect dive of a motel on the \'Lolita\' roadtrip that the \'just friends\' abruptly take together, Carol betrays its true priorities.',positive
'Son of Saul is not simply a good film, it feels like an urgent and important one, a warning from history.',positive
'Loneliness and longing are at the center of these two women\'s lives, at least for a while, and they\'re expressed by nuance and implication in a pair of superb performances, and by a lovely evocation of the period.',positive
'Only the combined talents of both Blanchett and Mara can make the film\'s powerfully realized finale work.',positive
'The movie ambles along amiably enough for a while; it\'s better if you are a fan of one or more members of the cast.',positive
'Blanchett gets everything right -- the accent, her German dialogue, the weary sexuality (deliberately reminiscent of Marlene Dietrich) and the amorality her character has embraced.',positive
'Sicario is a tentacled drug cartel thriller grabbing viewers by the throat and squeezing for two hours. This movie continually defies the conventions of its genre, from its hero\'s gender to the vagueness of its morality.',positive
'The stop-motion technique never ceases to fascinate, but the episodic structure of Shaun the Sheep Movie hinders any true emotional buildup and payoff.',positive
'The allure of the road not taken and Saoirse Ronan\'s performance exert a powerful pull.',positive
'A polished, engrossing procedural, Spotlight offers plenty of old-fashioned pleasures \' chiefly, the sight of smart, scrappy muckraking journalists stopping at nothing to uncover systematic corruption.',positive
'James White is a masterful examination of how our behavior and the excuses we make about our lives fall away under certain, life-changing conditions.',positive
'Straight Outta Compton is among the most potent rags-to-riches showbiz movies ever made.',positive
'It\'s not iconic sci-fi to match Alien or Blade Runner but it is a topical, supremely crafted, intelligent, heartfelt spectacle with gallows humour to die for. Strap yourself in.',positive
'Damon has never seemed more at home than he does here, millions of miles adrift.',positive
'Truth is a journalism horror story, something like \'All the President\'s Men\' but with the wrong ending and plenty of blame on all sides. It is one of the most frustrating speak-truth-to-power tales ever put onscreen, because it dares to show how that usually works out: Power wins. Big.',positive
'Crimson Peak is a cobwebs-and-candelabras chamber piece that\'s so preoccupied with being visually stunning it forgets to be scary.',positive
'James White looks like a simple film on its surface.... But despite the v\'rit\'-influenced stylization, writer-director Mond (whose own struggle with loss likely inspired some of this story) doesn\'t seem too interested in realism or grit.',positive
'Shaun the Sheep might look like an exciting, no-nonsense tale for little kids \' and it totally is, on one level \' but beneath its pitch-perfect simplicity lies great wisdom and beauty.',positive
'Straight Outta Compton proves as infectiously entertaining as it is educational thanks to F. Gary Gray\'s richly textured direction and a thumping soundtrack that confirms rap as the protest music of its time.',positive
'What\'s surprising \' even wondrous \' is how often Schulz\'s precisely crooked line work informs the big-budget gloss.',positive
'As an intimate chamber piece with pitch-dark subject matter, James White could only avoid bathos by featuring two actors at the top of their game, alive not only to the inner worlds of their own characters but to the shared world they both know they\'re on the brink of losing.',positive
'Anomalisa might be bizarre, surreal and far out, but it always feels paradoxically real, grounded and deeply true.',positive
'At times, Sicario is a deeply satisfying, intense examination of a war with no rules of engagement, driven by a spectacular performance by Benicio Del Toro and typically mesmerizing cinematography from Roger Deakins. At other times, especially in its middle act, Sicario can be frustratingly self-indulgent.',positive
'The comic strip\'s late creator Charles M. Schulz would undoubtedly approve of The Peanuts Movie, given his progeny have ensured the film remains true to his artistic and humanist vision.',positive
'An enthralling and rigorously realistic outer-space survival story.',positive
'The violence is shocking, effective and soaked into the dry brown landscape.',positive
'The Martian is the most purely enjoyable picture Scott has made in years. The streamlined narrative and the film\'s consistent pacing, aided by a cast who don\'t make a wrongfooted move, makes for easy popcorn entertainment.',positive
'Unlike the \'70s Italian cannibal movies, The Green Inferno doesn\'t have a mondo vibe. It\'s artfully made and acted with skill.',positive
'The star of Brooklyn is Fiona Weir \' not a person who appears on screen at any stage, but the woman who cast it.',positive
'The film serves as an authentic examination of the mid-twentieth-century immigrant experience \' and an intimate exploration of one woman\'s attempt to understand who she is and where she wants to belong.',positive
'This is science fiction for sophisticated audiences and, as such, a fulfilling and satisfying experience.',positive
'It\'s such stately, evocative, confident filmmaking, the only reservation being that it\'s also a bit chilly.',positive
'Spotlight is a great newspaper movie, ranking up there with All the President\'s Men and Citizen Kane, and it\'s certainly the best of its kind since The Paper in 1994, which also happened to star Michael Keaton.',positive
'The most engrossing part of Truth is the gradual, grueling retreat from the story, first by its participants and then by the network that broadcast it.',positive
'Spotlight is a gripping detective story and a superlative newsroom drama, a solid procedural that tries to confront evil without sensationalism.',positive
'Ignore the tell and focus on the show, spectacular in every sense.',positive
'It\'s possible to be heartwarming and tough-minded, as this wonderful film demonstrates. And it\'s possible to be both \'old-fashioned\' and vibrant, too. It\'s the best new/old movie in town.',positive
'While director Jamie Babbit, who cut her teeth on indie comedies, is an equal- opportunity offender, some jokes land better than others. Still, strong lead performances and an energetic supporting cast elevate the uneven material.',positive
'This is in many ways a companion piece to Haynes\' \'Far From Heaven\' (2002), which remains one of my favorite films so far this century.',positive
'There\'s no tidy moral to take away, because a story like this shouldn\'t end in comfort. Instead, your skin\'s left prickling by its deft deconstruction of the business of secret-keeping, and its perceptive setting out of the courage and diligence it takes to overturn it.',positive
'To say that Vulgar is not for all tastes might be the understatement of the year. For starters, this black comedy has a male rape scene that makes the one in Deliverance seem mild by comparison.',positive
'It confronts the hard realities of a world in which few make it to maturity without their share of scars, and no one makes it out of adulthood alive.',positive
'By turns thrilling, disorienting and draining, Sicario exists in a border zone seemingly of its own devising between the art film and the action movie.',positive
'It\'s when the walk portion of The Walk arrives that this unevenly scripted, fact-based thriller achieves its full potential. Even without the suspense of uncertainty, the sequence achieves a bated-breath intensity and wonder.',positive
'War Room is a gold-plated piece of Bible thumping that\'s resonating with the same audience that watches Jimmy Stewart get touched by an angel every December in It\'s a Wonderful Life \' and cry next to Christmas trees, despite that film\'s many hackneyed religious devices.',positive
'A disorienting puzzle of a movie with many exhilarating pieces, Anomalisa nevertheless maintains a straightforward trajectory involving Michael\'s internal strife.',positive
'Unusual for a Holocaust drama, the film offers no false hope of rescue or resurrection, but does insist that our bearing witness matters.',positive
'F. Gary Gray\'s Straight Outta Compton starts out strong, peaks quickly, and then gets tangled in complications and compromise and falls apart.',positive
'Its sombre sincerity and hypnotic, treasure-box beauty make Crimson Peak feel like a film out of time \' but Del Toro, his cast and his crew carry it off without a single postmodern prod or smirk. The film wears its heart on its sleeve, along with its soul and most of its intestines.',positive
'Co-director Starzack was one of the guiding hands behind the series version of Shaun the Sheep, and that experience in the kind of brisk, skit-based comedy that makes the series so charming shows through here in stand-alone scenes.',positive
'Blanchett burns on a high flame, and Redford finds the wounded dignity in Rather.',positive
'Kormakur doesn\'t make the mistake of exalting his subjects as extraordinary individuals, or suggesting that they were obeying some sort of noble higher calling. Everest is blunt, businesslike and \' as it begins its long march through the death zone \' something of an achievement.',positive
'Unsurprisingly for a Del Toro film, the production design is the real star of Crimson Peak.',positive
'Charlie Kaufman is back \' with a wistful, resonant film, a bracing, wry, honest dose of cinematic melancholy.',positive
'Soaring, swooning and gently nostalgic, Brooklyn takes melodrama to a new level of reassuring simplicity and emotional transparency.',positive
'The weirdness of Truth \' and, I fear, its involuntary comic value \' arises from a disparity between the sparse and finicky minutiae of the narrative and the somewhat bouffant style of the presentation.',positive
'The film\'s police-procedural action is unimaginatively presented, but Oyelowo is compelling.',positive
'By now, we\'ve grown accustomed to the signature touch of Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump), who is one of the best creative minds to see the innovative narrative potential lying dormant in technical cinematographic advances. This does not always provide the underpinnings for great stories, but bien s\'r his movies are almost always quite something to see.',positive
'The 17-minute wire-walking sequence is the most majestic simulation of a real event since the ship sinking in Titanic\'a dazzling triumph of photorealistic digital effects, which exhibits Zemeckis\' mastery of both CGI and pace.',positive
'With compassion, a touch of melancholy and a sense of wonder, Brooklyn reveals the profound truths in a simple, familiar story, ending on a note that\'s achingly bittersweet, no matter where you\'re from.',positive
'Carol is gorgeous, gently groundbreaking, and might be the saddest thing you\'ll ever see. More than hugely accomplished cinema, it\'s an exquisite work of American art, rippling with a very specific mid-century melancholy, understanding love as the riskiest but most necessary gamble in anyone\'s experience.',positive
'A decent idea that never goes deep enough for genuine satisfaction.',mixed
'The players are a colourful bunch, the film referencing is smart, the football satire sharp and there are delightful moments of visual imagination in the appealing animation.',mixed
'It\'s all too dumb and ribald for most tastes, but if you liked all the zombie comedies that came before, well, here\'s another one.',mixed
'Sinister 2 is far from perfect, but it has a nobility that\'s rare in much modern horror cinema.',mixed
'It\'s a film about micromanaging, fixing things on the fly, and a lot of Ridley\'s gruff, technocrat personality shines through.',mixed
'The Last Witch Hunter is redeemed through complex visual-effects work that aptly illuminates Goodman\'s netherworld. Further, Diesel\'s stolid performance is balanced through the supporting star power of Caine \' even with criminally limited scenes \' and Rose Leslie\'s \'dream walker,\' whose earnestness makes even the world of a macho witch hunter seem entirely plausible.',mixed
'At no point in the entire film is any character allowed to have any fun at all, which is a rather devastating flaw for a movie that\'s supposed to be set in an eternal wonderland of play and arrested childhood innocence.',mixed
'The film conveys the sense of hanging out with a band despite the fact that we almost never see them talking to us; a mood of creative ferment overrides any detailed narrative, and although its time period includes a massive tour for the group\'s latest album, this is definitely not a concert film.',mixed
'All of this is intoned with such a humourless sense of self-importance that anyone who genuinely loves their music (such as this reviewer who [full disclosure] would rate Funeral and Neon Bible as two of the best albums of recent years) finds themselves alternately stuffing their fingers in their ears or, when it gets too excruciating, their elbows.',mixed
'Consistently off by a beat, Hitman: Agent 47 fails to ever click into gear.',mixed
'What\'s most curious is Mr. Labute\'s kid-glove treatment of the scenario, forgoing real sexual gamesmanship, much less the opportunistic rug-pulling in past films. That baseline of sincerity is refreshing to a point, yet he\'s written a fairly weak-tea story of conflicted self-discovery that would make for a mildly engaging evening on the stage.',mixed
'Crimson Peak is a gorgeous mediocrity.',mixed
'Featuring none of its predecessor\'s sumptuous pitch-black visuals and sense of creeping dread, Ciaran Foy\'s follow-up is a misbegotten venture at every turn, in large part because it follows the horror sophomore rulebook so closely.',mixed
'The film is as thin as a picture postcard.',mixed
'What should have been a tautly paced B-movie thriller instead comes to feel like a mini-series, leaving the viewer too much time to ponder the silliness of its narrative contrivances.',mixed
'Heist nonetheless has a B-movie appeal thanks to its strong ensemble and wacky commitment to its overcomplicated, wildly absurd plotting.',mixed
'Sinister 2 doesn\'t know what it wants to be, and doesn\'t add up to much.',mixed
'Of The Good German, it can be said that the operation was a brilliant success, even if the patient is not merely dead but most sincerely dead. The movie, in other words, lies there as if on a slab in a morgue, while you admire the corpse for its beauty.',mixed
'Following the celebrity guru into Thailand for his ordainment as a Buddhist monk, the film is at its best when Gotham can\'t help but see through his father, who seems entirely restless without an audience and a smartphone through which to be reminded of their adoration of him.',mixed
'Nothing nearly so wacky or grotesque goes down in this romantic thriller, but you\'ll wish it would.',mixed
'If only Ghost Dimension spent more time in the ghost dimension and less time in the people dimension, we might have had something.',mixed
'By making it so that everyone can see the evil coming, it also robs the franchise of one of its most potent pleasures: studying the frame for signs of trouble, little telltale hints that something is about to go horribly, horribly wrong. Sentient inkblots are a poor substitution for that sensation.',mixed
'The movie itself is an intriguing but ultimately unspecial Feds-vs.-hoods drama. But as the sinister, snakelike South Boston criminal Whitey Bulger, Depp delivers.',mixed
'For all its storytelling shortcomings, The Walk is a must-see for its perilous, vertiginous, sweaty-palmed finale and its reminder that the Twin Towers can be remembered for much more than 9/11.',mixed
'Deftly made and diverting for young audiences but unlikely to linger, with any vibrancy tempered by the familiarity of the tune.',mixed
'Like so many meathead action thrillers, it\'s too busy fogging the windows with hot air to see the big picture.',mixed
'Crimson Peak\'s astonishing visuals don\'t enhance its story (co-written by the director and Matthew Robbins); they overwhelm it, encouraging us to stand back and admire the look when we should be involved in the emotional mechanics of this lurid tale.',mixed
'Genre fans close in age to the characters depicted onscreen should be appreciative of the enjoyably familiar mix of inspired comedy moments, smart zingers, grossout gags and nudity offered by the apostrophe-phobic Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse.',mixed
'Big Stone Gap isn\'t everyone\'s cup of sweet tea. It\'s a homespun tale populated by broadly drawn characters and solid actors \' Whoopi Goldberg, Jane Krakowski, Anthony LaPaglia \' sounding like they gulped hush puppy batter.',mixed
'Truth should have felt like a tragedy, a story about a monumental but fascinating failure of journalism, the flip side to the upcoming Spotlight, about the Boston Globe\'s Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation of sexual abuse within the Catholic church. Instead, Truth wants to make your blood boil. It succeeds \' but not in the way the filmmakers intended.',mixed
'While Les eventually becomes more tolerable, LaBute\'s cloying dialogue makes it impossible to appreciate what turns out to be a bracingly pragmatic sense of optimism.',mixed
'Johnny Depp makes a valiant stab at the part, but even with his hair thinned and lightened and his face hardened, Depp remains Depp: I never forgot I was watching a big star doing an impersonation. It\'s as if the spirit of a psychopath like Bulger resists the camera. Or maybe the movie isn\'t imaginative enough to penetrate his shell.',mixed
'It\'s hard to shake the suspicion that Depp is playing a type \' almost as if he\'s trying to replicate the kind of performance Nicholson might have given in the same role. You long for him to roll his sleeves up and grasp the character\'s shape and soul himself, ideally without the aid of those distracting prosthetics.',mixed
'Director Joe Wright\'s movie barely gets off the ground, and gets old quickly.',mixed
'Not half as terrifying as Norwegian black metal, but still one of the better found footage-gimmicked sequels in recent memory.',mixed
'The insertion of attractive Hollywood stars into a daunting landscape makes for some odd contradictions of scale as the story unfolds with white-knuckle inevitability. [28 Sept. 2015, p.61]',mixed
'Hitman: Agent 47 might offer a passable diversion for action junkies but, for everyone else, it\'s best avoided.',mixed
'Though it assembles a first-rate cast in a story taken from reality, Everest feels icebound and strangely abstract, lacking the gravity of genuine tragedy or the swagger of first-rate adventure.',mixed
'Despite a twisty, juicy and compelling story, there remains a staid conventionality that keeps the political and thematic undercurrents from being explored as satisfyingly as one might hope.',mixed
'It\'s Bulger whose grim appearance and even grimmer behaviour \'Black Mass\' indulges. But it\'s the quieter, more complicated Connolly who offers the film\'s subtler pleasures.',mixed
'Whatever power this piece of writing had over the two of them, Captive fails to capture the magic, hope or whatever made it a best seller.',mixed
'It\'s a play shoehorned into a film. Sometimes that can work \' LaBute\'s managed it before \' but it\'s a steep hill to climb, and this one doesn\'t quite make it.',mixed
'For sheer, sepulchral eye candy at this most horror-ific time of year, del Toro\'s Crimson Peak leaves Tim Burton \' reigning misfit king of hyper-stylized, goth-y weirdness \' in the dust and well-nigh forgotten.',mixed
'Far from the worst movie of 2006, but it may be the most disappointing. It should have been wonderful -- a delicious tribute to classic Hollywood -- but it simply doesn\'t come off.',mixed
'The Green Inferno is less a riff on spaghetti splatter flicks like Cannibal Holocaust than a desperate-to-shock pastiche of guts and gore served with a wink to audiences with strong stomachs. You know who you are.',mixed
'In many ways the film feels like a regression -- it\'s more juvenile, less polished and feels less labored over than his previous efforts.',mixed
'The Peanuts Movie isn\'t so much an homage as it is an echo and a call-back, one that certainly has heart but also feels dispiritingly riskless.',mixed
'Spotlight never hits the heights of passion, but capably and decently tells an important story.',mixed
'Attempting a frame-by-frame duplication of Warner Bros. \'40s filmmaking--even the extroverted acting style apes the period--Soderbergh has produced a movie so self-conscious that it\'s drained of all life.',mixed
'It\'s clear that Straight Outta Compton is at once too padded and too thin. It\'s as if the story of these real-life legends was so unruly and dangerous that the filmmakers became the cops, forcing it into submission.',mixed
'Long on heart if short on surprises, Big Stone Gap is an easygoing visit to small-town America.',mixed
'Straight Outta Compton soars for an hour before spiralling into a bloated, melodramatic mess. Still, it\'s worth it for the early ferocity, capturing just how powerful N.W.A really were.',mixed
'The leads acquit themselves relatively well here, hinting at the interesting character study that could have been, but by the end the only captive left is the viewer.',mixed
'Good grief! This painfully sincere animated feature seems aimed less at contemporary kids than nostalgic adults who might buy toys marketed for what is being billed as the 50th anniversary of the Peanuts gang for their children and grandchildren.',mixed
'Cate Blanchett gives a ferocious performance as the steely Mapes, and she mines some genuine emotion out of the material.',mixed
'Ultimately, though, Dirty Weekend is a vague, languid affair.',mixed
'As high-class cheese goes, Truth slips down fine. It\'s a noisy, one-note rally for the converted that gets your pulse racing even if you\'re rolling your eyes.',mixed
'Big Stone Gap suffers from some hokey moments, including an ending that\'s both implausible and too heavy on the sap.',mixed
'90 Minutes is one of the better faith-based films out there.',mixed
'Sinister 2 may be ambitious, but its best ideas are, as they\'re expressed, dumb, unmoving, and repetitive.',mixed
'The first words spoken in Victor Frankenstein are \'You know the story,\' and anyone who simply mutters \'Yep,\' gets up, and heads back to the box office for a refund will be well ahead of the game.',mixed
'Airless visual treatment and mannered performances compound the impression that LaBute might have been better off saving this material for the stage, though it\'d be a pretty tame trifle in either context.',mixed
'Christensen underplays throughout 90 Minutes in Heaven, even in scenes when Piper isn\'t operating under the influence of painkillers, and his earnestness often comes off as monotonous. Still, he generates interest and sympathy, almost in spite of himself, and Bosworth lends capable support as a loyal spouse.',mixed
'Dirty Weekend is entertaining enough to spawn a Les-and-Natalie odd-couple sitcom, but it does come across as dated.',mixed
'It looks shiny enough to keep the kids engaged, but not so new and improved that it\'ll alienate nostalgic parents. The movie strikes that balance, adding a bell here, a whistle there.',mixed
'Unfortunately, this promising material turns out to be merely the setup for a thoroughly generic action flick in which a gang of thieves without much honor attempt to pull off one last big heist. In the long, dispiriting slide to mediocrity thereafter, McGregor largely relapses into cute-rascal mode.',mixed
'Sinister 2 comes up a bit short on creative resources, although director Ciaran Foy probably gets enough right to entice those partial to the original.',mixed
'My All American plays like an extended highlights reel, not a movie.',mixed
'It\'s easy to laugh at the arrant contrivances and heavy-handed dialogue in the script penned by Alex and Stephen Kendrick. But it\'s even easier to admire the persuasive sincerity and emotional potency of the lead performances by Shirer and Stallings, who do not transcend their material so much as imbue it with conviction.',mixed
'The actors are committed \' Mara, generally waif-like, appears frail indeed \' but there\'s barely anything worth committing to.',mixed
'Despite the surface sheen, and some enterprising plot twists, it doesn\'t entirely convince.',mixed
'That\'s the nature of Truth: a promising build-up, dead-ending into prosaic pontification.',mixed
'At least three entertaining films are jostling for position in Australian writer-director Julius Avery\'s messily propulsive debut feature, Son of a Gun \' and if none ultimately emerges dominant, the red-blooded tussle between them is never dull to watch.',mixed
'There\'s not much fault to find with Sicario on the level of craft or performances, just its rather sputtering momentum, and the lack of a higher purpose.',mixed
'A sweet tale with a smart storytelling device and charming performers, but not much more beyond the cute.',mixed
'Persecuted is a profoundly conservative, Christian ideological take, guised as a classic Seventies paranoid thriller. Certainly unique, this is another targeted release, specifically aimed at groups sharing its beliefs.',mixed
'Its aspirations to high-end production values and the inventive use of urban cityscapes filmed from carefully selected futuristic angles are all very well, but it could have done with something a little looser, more punk, more grimy, more stoned.',mixed
'Decoding ultimately becomes Gotham\'s gentle tribute to Dad, who shall probably provide handsomely for his heirs. It is also a tacit endorsement of Chopra Inc.',mixed
'Premature bops along with a wiseacre self-awareness and a nimble cast... But Mr. Beers and his fellow screenwriter, Mathew Harawitz, also have a numbing Seth MacFarlane-esque weakness for purely attention-getting crudeness and unfunny stereotypes.',mixed
'Overall, while the film is a gorgeous, nostalgic cinema experience, and there\'s definitely a multiple of mini-plots to unravel while you work towards the final resolution, the film comes up as a bit of a dud.',mixed
'The savagery here is rooted in retrograde myths that might have been easier to stomach had the cannibalism been positioned as a fantastical unleashing of retribution.',mixed
'This might have made a decent eye-candy musical for kids. But aside from Nirvana and a choral \'Blitzkrieg Bop\' by the miner kids, there is no music.',mixed
'The partying is as bland as any all-purpose music video and feels more like another script signpost (and audience-pandering) than a serious attempt to get out what it means to be young, black, gifted, fabulously wealthy and much desired. Mr. Gray does far better when the story edges into heavier, more dappled realms.',mixed
'All of the film\'s nuances are ultimately negated by the its relentless canonization of its subject.',mixed
'Black Mass is ultimately a decent film with some great parts, but unfortunately it falls short of the canon to which it aspires.',mixed
'Battling a preposterous plot and second-tier performances that are, at best, serviceable, this roll-along thriller from Scott Mann works its keister off to turn beef jerky into chateaubriand.',mixed
'A patchy biopic that only thrills when Gordon-Levitt finally steps out onto the wire. Still, for all the 3D showboating, it\'s a touching tribute to the Twin Towers.',mixed
'A jumbled third act and an indifferent ending ultimately make Hellions disappointing. But there\'s a bit of fun to be had in its opening frights, and in trying to figure out what these costumed little monsters really want.',mixed
'However flavorsome though, The Good German is seriously deficient in the stars\' star power and narrative excitement. The movie is lovingly framed, carefully lit, and fatally insipid. The direction is slack; the pacing is perfunctory.',mixed
'Only Radcliffe escapes unscathed, lending Igor a convincing psychology despite the ham-fistedness of the material. But he\'s not enough of a reason to resurrect this story again.',mixed
'My All American would have done better to dig deeper in its portrayal of a man who set such a high bar for the intrinsic character of a football player. Because he\'s actually the kind of example the sport could really use right now.',mixed
'Formulated on an idiotic idea and develops a predictably lackluster motion picture from it.',mixed
'The only thing more boring than this comedy about two colleagues on a layover in Albuquerque might be an actual layover in Albuquerque.',mixed
'Its intentions are noble. Its gaze is harshly realistic. But it\'s also overly melodramatic. Bettany has the makings of better director than screenwriter.',mixed
'The hardship of the trek is vividly and stomach-lurchingly portrayed, particularly when the storm sets in, but it never makes the crucial leap from the screen into your bones.',mixed
'On the plus side, the film is high energy and moves quickly. And some of the zombie gore effects are fun, reaching nearly Raimi-esque heights of splatter during the climactic battle. None of it is really scary, though, especially since it\'s so predictable.',mixed
'While it\'s impossible not to be somewhat caught up in these climbers\' life-or-death struggle, Everest is oddly uninvolving \' it depicts a horrific scenario in an underwhelming, distancing way.',mixed
'Even filmmakers and actors as fine as these haven\'t managed to solve one of cinema\'s most enduring challenges \' making criminals interesting without exalting them.',mixed
'The story The Walk tells is, admittedly, an unbelievable one, so it\'s understandable Zemeckis should choose to leave subtlety at the door. Sadly, such an approach strips the film of tension, especially at the crucial moment.',mixed
'This should have been Soderbergh gold. Instead it is mostly unengaging and dull, proof positive that they don\'t make them like they used to.',mixed
'Plenty of striking, clever, effective movies have been made simply by re-arranging and re-calibrating familiar genre elements. Hellions might have been one of these, if it was predicated on something slightly less shallow than \'kids in masks + chanting + blood = scary.\'',mixed
'All three actors work hard... and when the melodrama hits fever pitch, Crimson Peak lurches into life. But overall this lacks weight and intensity: a Bront\'-esque bauble smeared in twenty-first-century slickness.',mixed
'Greer and Lyonne play off each other well; the combination of readily corruptible innocence and reluctantly innocent corruption elevate the material. Their badinage and interactions suggest a genuine sisterly relationship, with a long history ofresentments, betrayals, and co-dependence. Too bad the filmmakers try too hard at making you laugh, and not hard enough at making you feel.',mixed
'The new Ridley Scott movie is fascinating and charming and crammed and overstuffed, and it\'s a curious case, too. It gets all the seemingly hard things wonderfully right, but then caves in at points that should have been easy.',mixed
'The film reawakens long-repudiated notions of white supremacy and such, but Mr. Roth is surely not trying to peddle them. He\'s merely seeing if he can replicate the formula of the subgenre. And he does, fairly slickly, in fact.',mixed
'The result is at once labor of love and cautionary tale: Apparently too close to the story to recognize how ill suited she was to translating its charms to the screen, Trigiani has emerged with nothing but corny, stilted Americana, like something Garrison Keillor might burp out on a really off day.',mixed
'I hold Soderbergh in high esteem, but as handsome a technical achievement as it is, The Good German plays to me as a failed experiment.',mixed
'Avery can\'t commit to whether he\'s making a gritty Animal Kingdom-style crime picture, or a light caper film, and the final result is wonky in the extreme, particularly in the conclusion, which feels particularly muddled.',mixed
'Soderbergh doesn\'t miss a trick, and for a while it\'s fun for us to share in his fun. But there comes a moment when his Euro-noir film turns into another sort of exercise for the audience: an exercise in boredom.',mixed
'Pizzo finds nearly no drama in Freddie\'s path from high school to college ball.',mixed
'Vanderbilt chooses to present the tale with a lighter comic touch in the early stages, and it\'s a tone the picture can\'t overcome in its final third.',mixed
'Michael Ealy has a very ominous stare and Sanaa Lathan sells her inconsistent character pretty well, but The Perfect Guy is still just a boilerplate stalker story that proceeds more or less as you suspect it will.',mixed
'This material cant help but be interesting, even compelling up to a point, but its prosaic presentation suggests that the story\'s full potential, encompassing deep, disturbing and enduring pain on all sides of the issue, has only begun to be touched.',mixed
'Though much of the drama is clunky and flat, the taut, visceral performances by David Oyelowo and Kate Mara never err.',mixed
'Still, you find yourself rooting for these women, even if their adventures aren\'t always up to snuff.',mixed
'Heist is competently staged, but Scott Mann maintains audience interest with the preponderance of dissonant absurdities.',mixed
'The heist in Heist is pretty pedestrian, and the film turns into Die Hard-on-a-bus with a couple of so-so twists and serviceable spasms of action. If that\'s what you\'re looking for, rent Speed instead.',mixed
'The plot itself has little momentum, and what should feel dramatic instead feels inert.',mixed
'The movie is pleasant and charming, but when making a big-screen adaptation of a beloved classic and genuine touchstone for generations, adequate doesn\'t feel like quite enough.',mixed
'Recreating the crime for The Walk, director Robert Zemeckis does a crackerjack job with the thrills and a so-so one with the laughs (at least the intentional ones) and skips the deeper magic altogether.',mixed
'Although first-time feature writer-director Julius Avery may aspire to become a sort of Aussie Michael Mann \' and perhaps lays an apt foundation here to do so \' he has a ways to go in developing the kind of characters and world we can solidly invest in.',mixed
'This \'Guide\' is not for everyone; it gleefully earns its hard-R rating. But folks who enjoy their teen humor splattered with zombie guts won\'t be disappointed. Scout\'s honor.',mixed
'For actor and director, the project seems like trying on a new coat, and it doesn\'t fit either of them.',mixed
'It\'s not that Pan isn\'t entertaining. There\'s plenty of color and action and some inventive 3-D effects. Jackman\'s unhinged performance is either gloriously great or gloriously terrible, but captivating either way. There\'s no magic, though.',mixed
'Would the movie be as (barely) entertaining as it is without De Niro? He only has about 15 minutes\' worth of scenes in Heist, but whenever he\'s on-screen the film almost feels legitimate.',mixed
'Hugh Jackman gives the movie a bit of twinkle as a pirate who breathes pixie dust to stay fresh and relevant. Maybe the people behind Pan should have snorted some.',mixed
'Son Of A Gun has the gritty, rough feel of 1970s heist/hit picture',mixed
'The Last Witch Hunter aims for pulpy, comic-book fun, but it\'s never as fleet, funny, or detailed as it needs to be. And if you\'re looking for something above middling in terms of plot, characters, world-building, even action sequences, you\'ll need to seek it elsewhere.',mixed
'The Good German is a prime example of a movie made by highly skilled and intelligent filmmakers that nevertheless seems misguided from the get-go.',mixed
'Newbie director Aleksander Bach handles the project with a competent precision. The film doesn\'t rise above the genre and the plot is muddled, but he pulls off the basic elements with a distinctly chilly European style.',mixed
'As directed by Robert Zemeckis from a script he co-wrote with Christopher Browne, the film limps through its first two acts, putting in time until the big moment.',mixed
'To the bitter end, the series manages to wring some fun, solid scares out of something other invading something utterly familiar.',mixed
'Del Toro gets the ghostly elements right, with red and black flesh-torn spooks wailing warnings to the receptive Edith. But he goes wildly overboard in aiming for atmosphere after the story shifts to the Sharpes\' crumbling English manor.',mixed
'Everest is visually splendid, though it loses a few points for its murkiness in rendering its main characters as distinct individuals.',mixed
'Kids still experiencing World Cup withdrawal symptoms may be entertained by this animated oddity from Argentina.',mixed
'Izzo, who co-starred with Roth-the-actor in Aftershock, is a fine genre actress, standing out from a cast of blonde women with her naturalistic performance and signs of courage and initiative.',mixed
'Everest is a frustrating movie in many ways \' despite some lurches and shocks, it doesn\'t quite deliver the edge-of-your-seat thrills that many were hoping for, and all those moderately engaging characters mean that there is no centrally powerful character.',mixed
'Shelter is a well-intentioned film that edges into misery porn.',mixed
'Delve into the story at your own risk, but embrace the unrepentant stupidity of it all and there\'s a zen-like joy to be found in this screenvomit of adolescent violence.',mixed
'This reimagining features some fun production design and a performance of undiluted bug-eyed flamboyance from James McAvoy as the titular pale student of unhallowed arts, but its reservoirs of energy and ingenuity run dry long before the finale, leaving the film to lumber to its half-hearted conclusion.',mixed
'Aflame with color and awash in symbolism, this undeniably ravishing yet ultimately disappointing haunted-house meller is all surface and no substance, sinking under the weight of its own self-importance into the sanguine muck below.',mixed
'Unfortunately, the unbridled shock value isn\'t matched by a similar investment in other ingredients that might have made this low rent B-movie worthwhile.',mixed
'Despite its serious imperfections, the soapy escapism provided by The Perfect Guy at least arrives at an opportune time.',mixed
'Fascinating in concept but a disaster in execution.',mixed
'Soderbergh\'s homage to film noir and wartime thrillers, is technically stunning but narratively and thematically hollow.',mixed
'A likable horror-comedy with a satisfyingly high splatter count.',mixed
'While the two leads are appealing and display an undeniable chemistry, the narrative skimpiness makes their efforts for naught.',mixed
'There\'s a lot of \'this was really important,\' and \'this changed us,\' but very little in the way of specifics. Maybe they couldn\'t put their fingers on it, and that\'s fine, but there\'s no sense that they even considered digging deeper. Still, several live performances and some powerful fly-on-the-wall moments make it tough to dismiss Reflektor Tapes entirely.',mixed
'It doubles down on gross-out sight gags that 13-year-old boys should find hilarious, if no one else.',mixed
'The film goes in for the idea of texture and tics and human behavior, but there\'s no conviction, and no real push for eccentricity.',mixed
'Without Ewan McGregor in the lead, this flashy but aggressively superficial Aussie thriller would likely disappear without a trace.',mixed
'Not even the film\'s occasional bursts of ultra-violence, or the endlessly oozing red clay, or Hiddleston crying a red tear, or Chastain swanning around in one flaming crimson ball gown after another, can infuse this gorgeous bore with anything like red-blooded suspense.',mixed
'The blood-soaked \'Inferno\' practically ends up a promotional snuff film for deforestation.',mixed
'Bolstered by strong performances and a tight narrative, Son Of A Gun is an admirable debut film from Avery, and a worthy new entry into Australia\'s burgeoning class of crime features.',mixed
'Decoding Deepak does not feel, as it might, like an indictment of those messages but rather a straightforward portrait of someone working hard to present the product he is selling.',mixed
'The feature film Everest provides soaring visuals, but it\'s a distant second in terms of storytelling depth and narrative impact.',mixed
'If you feel anything other than admiration for its craftsmanship, let me know; The Good German is as emotionally cold and unconvincing as any movie I\'ve seen this year.',mixed
'There\'s no denying that Pan is one ambitious fairy tale. But what\'s being labeled a wholly original adventure feels far from new, never mind necessary.',mixed
'As Kaulder, Diesel does what he does, rumbling out lines of silly dialogue in his subwoofer of a voice. As far as acting goes, there\'s not much.',mixed
'Everest is a sprawling mess of a movie, one you feel like could have been great but instead roams all over the place and winds up being just pretty good.',mixed
'It\'s flabby and repetitive, but peppered with moments of exquisite sonic lusciousness \' not unlike the album itself.',mixed
'The film feels dodgy, tentative and uncertain as to how to frame its own protagonist in a complicated story of journalistic compromise (and worse).',mixed
'Crimson Peak ends up feeling like a bit of make-work, a project to keep the visionary filmmaker busy until something that truly sparks his passion comes along.',mixed
'Steven Soderbergh is usually an inspired chameleon, perfectly suiting his style to his content. But The Good German is an ambitious miss...It\'s all very beautiful, high-minded, and remote.',mixed
'Visual stakes are heightened here, to an absurd, laugh-inspiring degree, the deaths sliding into the realm of \'Saw\'-style ridiculousness.',mixed
'Mr. Cooper\'s direction is skillful, if overly reliant on borrowed Scorseseisms (especially when it comes to music), and the cast is first-rate, but the film is a muddle of secondhand attitudes and half-baked ideas. It feels more like a costume party than a costume drama.',mixed
'The Walk is much less than the sum of its parts, except when the parts are so good you can\'t ignore them.',mixed
'Although Sinister 2 continues the story begun in Scott Derrickson\'s creepily effective Sinister, it feels more like an unnecessary retread than an organic extension of the original.',mixed
'Alternately riveting and wearying, up-to-the-minute relevant as well as self-mythologizingly self-indulgent \' as much of a heroic origins story as anything out of the Marvel factory \' Straight Outta Compton ends up juggling more story lines and moods than it can handle.',mixed
'Lost in the Sun gets most elements right in order to put together one of those gritty and melancholic southern crime dramas, except for when it comes to producing a unique screenplay and direction that rises above mediocrity.',mixed
'The laughs are mild, but at least some exist.',mixed
'Maybe so much of Son of a Gun seems boring and directionless because so little of the dialogue is comprehensible. This is a problem that tanks so many imports these days.',mixed
'Although Captive largely succeeds as a two-hander, it stumbles in the minimal attempts to broaden the scope beyond Smith and Nichols\' time together.',mixed
'At once thinly conceived and maddeningly over-designed, irreverent and over-serious, and chock-full of strained references (to World War II, environmentalism, and drugs, among other things) and creepy violence, Pan is an elaborate flight of fancy with no vision \' which makes it strangely compelling in spots.',mixed
'At the end, the door is left open for a sequel, but Agent 47 doesn\'t feel like a character who\'s got what it takes to be a franchise hero. He, and the film, are lacking in personality.',mixed
'A wide-eyed tribute to human ingenuity that packs enough snark to pull itself out of the black hole of earnestness, even if its fuel runs out partway through.',mixed
'Oyelowo and Mara try to bring humanity and tension to the testimonial thriller of two lost souls finding their way together, but they only succeed in bursts, hampered by marketing copy masquerading as dialogue.',mixed
'The Paranormal Activity movies have always been about carnival-ride sensations, the narrative through-line secondary. That\'s fortunate, because those seeking closure to what continuity there has been will go home mostly disappointed.',mixed
'The Christian faith-based film genre takes a dramatic leap forward with 90 Minutes in Heaven, a well-appointed work based on Don Piper\'s bestseller, that, for a change, doesn\'t look and sound as though it was written, performed, and recorded in some church basement.',mixed
'The film disappointingly ditches the cartoonist\'s modest visual formula for a photorealistic 3-D playground courtesy of the animation studio behind Ice Age.',mixed
'In his genre pastiche The Good German, Steven Soderbergh has tried to resurrect the magic of classical Hollywood, principally by sucking out all the air, energy and pleasure from his own filmmaking.',mixed
'Trey Nelson\'s film can\'t help but evoke a feeling of d\'j\' vu. But strong performances by Josh Duhamel and young Josh Wiggins (Max), plus haunting visuals of the barren Texas setting, provide some compensation for the narrative contrivances of Lost in the Sun.',mixed
'Like its star, The Last Witch Hunter is big, overblown and frequently incomprehensible.',mixed
'Sicario occasionally seems a little too impressed by its own nihilism. Still, this is an involving, grown-up film from a director whose muscular technique continues to impress: one might call it pulp in the same manner one would a plate of minced meat.',mixed
'Still, those who adore the two stars will find some fun here. And if you don\'t \'know the story,\' you won\'t be nearly as bored as the rest of us.',mixed
'Feels like nothing less than Dana Carvey\'s desperate bid for his own Austin Powers-like franchise, but with a harmless humor far less crude. Carvey favors whoopee cushion punch lines to toilet gags and references to big butts over sexual double-entendres.',mixed
'Like its subject, the movie is not as calculating as it seems.',mixed
'In fashioning a creation myth for Peter Pan, director Joe Wright and writer Jason Fuchs have produced such a thin story that they reduce, rather than amplify, J.M. Barrie\'s famous characters.',mixed
'Aside from these few flourishes of the outr\' and symbolically charged, there\'s little to distinguish the movie from any number of overlong hit-by-hit music biopics of the nodding-approvingly-from-behind-a-mixing-console variety.',mixed
'The Martian is only partly a story about a man in peril; it\'s mostly a story about men (and a few women) taking control of the uncontrollable. It\'s confident, swaggering sci-fi, not the despairing kind. That may be why, as elaborate and expensive-looking as The Martian is, it\'s almost totally lacking in poetry.',mixed
'Despite an appealing trio of leads, it seems likely to entice only those with an unquenchable thirst for thriller cliches.',mixed
'Has a near-impossible mission: its title.',mixed
'Like any crime saga without a more potent thematic hook, the film\'s relentlessly insular script dwells on themes of loyalty and fraternity.',mixed
'There are laughs here, but easily as many groans.',mixed
'Featuring a stellar cast apparently seeking to prove that they\'re interested in being popular in red states as well as blue, Big Stone Gap goes down relatively easy, but it contains lots of empty calories.',mixed
'Son of a Gun, from first-time feature director Julius Avery, begins with an enticingly dark first act in jail, but descends steadily downward into a mass of clich\'s.',mixed
'There\'s way too much inside-baseball money talk here, when a simpler plot\'one about a band whose apocalyptic vision comes to pass\'would have been plenty.',mixed
'The script plays like something by an English major overstuffed with knowledge of lit but whose real-life experience is drawn largely from movies -- and whose simplistic views on race and class are straight out of the white liberal\'s But I mean well... handbook.',mixed
'The movie is much like its hero, Freddie \' straightforward, sweet, hard-working and predictable.',mixed
'My All American is awful; but it gets points, I suppose, for at least looking professional.',mixed
'The best and creepiest sequence involves a sort of beta test, during which a patchwork chimplike creature is brought to life and rampages about.',mixed
'Jackman occasionally wins a laugh, when he manages to impose himself over the movie\'s restless clamor.',mixed
'Straight Outta Compton doesn\'t shy entirely from the uglier side of the N.W.A. story, including the claims that their music and their lifestyles glorified thug life, perpetuated gun violence, advocated drug use and reveled in misogyny. Instead, Gray\'s film owns it.',mixed
'No one wants to live in the past, but in The Peanuts Movie, the old stuff still stands up, while the new story is just flimsy glue holding the classic bits in place.',mixed
'A curious hybrid of grim fairytale and gory horror, del Toro\'s ninth feature is striking but sorely lacking in surprises. Great ghosts, but del Toro is capable of so much more.',mixed
'The first half of Straight Outta Compton, F Gary Gray\'s two-and-a-half hour opus about the birth of west coast gangsta rap, is bursting with energy, exuberance and inspiration. The second half is immobilised by bloat and sanctification.',mixed
'By all accounts, Boston mobster James Whitey Bulger was a monster. That\'s exactly how Johnny Depp plays him in Black Mass, a dark blob of underworld cliches and bad contact lenses.',mixed
'Hayden and Perez do their best to generate sweetness and spark, but the obstacles separating these characters are as contrived as the cliches that animate them.',mixed
'Rather than pioneering into the frontiers of the mind, Listening slogs through the most well-traveled pits of screenwriting.',mixed
'The Walk is that rare movie that might please practically everyone, from viewers just looking for a thrill to those who might enjoy a story that sounds like a tall tale but winds up being discreetly poignant.',mixed
'Substitute a cat for the bunny (no spoilers here about its fate) and you have the ironically titled, generic thriller The Perfect Guy that somehow wound up on the big screen instead of on Lifetime.',mixed
'When all the parts are sewn together, the end result proves as crude and slapdash as the monster itself.',mixed
'Villeneuve\'s proven he\'s got a strong punch. The trouble is, he barely aims.',mixed
'A valiant effort that never quite scales the dizzy emotional heights required, running out of oxygen in the final act. Visually, though, it\'s stunning.',mixed
'This movie wasn\'t nearly as bad as I thought it would be. It\'s still not that good though.',mixed
'Unlike recent, sharp-witted examples like The Lego Movie and Paddington, there\'s zero interest in mocking or freshening up the material\'think what Wes Anderson might have done with this\'thus dooming the movie to nostalgic types only. It trudges along like that black, jagged stripe on our hero\'s yellow polo: up and down, scene by scene.',mixed
'Crimson Peak is locked in by a somnambulist, formulaic vibe and comes off as contented to go through Gothic 101 motions without recourse to reinvention or refreshing vigour.',mixed
'Oddest of all is how Truth whips through this, making noble statements about journalism while brushing off the failures to get it right. Mapes was busy and stressed. (Slow down!) The document authenticators had doubts. (Listen to them.) The source said he was lying before but is telling the truth now. (Don\'t trust him.)',mixed
'The script, by Beers and Mathew Harawitz, offers a little less invention in this endless-repeat scenario than it might have.',mixed
'A compelling story might have succeeded in overcoming those cosmetic distractions, but Bettany only offers an overwrought romance.',mixed
'Ultimately, Everest is not concerned with the why, but with the how and it\'s grimly efficient at building up the drama, helped on by Clarke\'s wonderful character study, even if the film as a whole never quite reaches the dizzying heights of its subject.',mixed
'Convincing performances from David Oyelowo and Kate Mara \' as an escaped killer and his drug addicted hostage \' are the saving grace of Captive, a decent dramatic thriller somewhat weighed down by its mildly religious message.',mixed
'After a while, you give up trying to make sense of the plot and sit there gaping at the car crashes, fight scenes, and shootings. The problem is that even the mayhem quickly becomes repetitive.',mixed
'Son of a Gun adds to the mystique that Australian crime films are meaner, nastier and more brutish than their American counterparts. But it changes style roughly every half-hour. And behind its macho preening is a preposterous, routinely executed story.',mixed
'Depp isn\'t doing anything different here than he did in Dark Shadows or Alice in Wonderland or the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Once again, he\'s unrecognizable under elaborate makeup and prosthetics, and he speaks with a peculiar voice (this time a thick South Boston accent).',mixed
'At its most basic level, the Paranormal Activity formula still has some kick, with its combination of creepy lo-fi video and tasteful suburbia creating some strong, unsettling dissonance.',mixed
'Steven Soderbergh\'s new film is a puzzle wrapped in a mystery inside a perversity. The puzzle is Mr. Soderbergh\'s approach to what might have been an intriguing experiment, rather than the off-putting one it turned out to be.',mixed
'It doesn\'t have the laughs or the killer cast of \'Superbad,\' but there are gory giggles aplenty in this B-movie addition to the genre that displaced vampires once Edward impregnated Bella.',mixed
'Mr. Villeneuve, aided by Taylor Sheridan\'s lean script, Roger Deakins\'s parched cinematography and Johann Johannsson\'s slow-moving heart attack of a score, respects the imperatives of genre while trying to avoid the usual clich\'s. It\'s not easy, and he doesn\'t entirely succeed.',mixed
'It\'s not about Peter Pan, but about what happened before Peter Pan. The noise you hear is J. M. Barrie turning over in his grave.',mixed
'As it meanders from over-familiar set-pieces and cliches \' Tahir drums on empty paint buckets for money, predators face them at every turn, a callous system trips them up, and when they break into that brownstone, naturally they play dress-up \' Shelter loses its way.',mixed
'For a movie about the importance of objectivity, Truth feels like a biased and sanctimonious op-ed column.',mixed
'A credit-sequence television clip of Mr. Warren and the real Ms. Smith with Oprah Winfrey makes the entire movie feel like the strangest book infomercial in memory.',mixed
'[A] strained, overheated thriller.',mixed
'The movie briefly picks up some warmth when John and Louis encounter a mother and daughter (Lynn Collins and Emma Fuhrmann) who are also in the midst of some self-discovery, but the movie seems unwilling to linger too long on it for fear of becoming rewarding.',mixed
'For a film supposedly about the transformative power of faith, Captive has very little to preach in that regard, apart from the importance of purchasing megachurch pastor Rick Warren\'s hit book, The Purpose Driven Life.',mixed
'It\'s all put together with a crisp confidence that suggests its writer-director will swiftly move on to bigger things.',mixed
'McGregor, who is having a bit of comeback moment right now, is kind of great as the ruthless antihero, and the action set pieces have plenty of fizz.',mixed
'This Grand Guignol riot of rotting animal and Godless creations is great fun. However, of the cast, it is only McAvoy, walking the line between madman and genius, who fully manages to hold his own against the spectacle with which he shares the screen.',mixed
'It\'s somehow both too drawn-out and abrupt \' but it\'s got creepiness galore.',mixed
'This vaguely science-fiction action picture based on a video game (and not a sequel to 2007\'s Hitman) is an idiotic mess with a bafflingly dense prologue, an endless final battle, lifeless performances and anticlimactic twists, but it does have a degree of visual flair.',mixed
'In this post-Mad Max: Fury Road action movie age, \'occasionally bonkers\' just doesn\'t cut it anymore.',mixed
'Don\'t expect too much of Heist \' it\'s a cheesy formula picture all the way \' but it has solid character foundations, the occasional bright line of dialogue (\'Cops, this is robbers,\' Morgan says on a phone call) and a neat final twist. As throwbacks go, it\'s more bearable than shoulder pads.',mixed
'I could have managed to bear all the film\'s shortcomings if it weren\'t for Clooney. Where was he during the making of this film? His face is there, he knows his lines, he moves as needed, but any traces of the intelligence and rapport, the subtlety and understanding, that have marked his best work are excruciatingly missing. Clooney behaves as if he discovered after he had committed to the film that he really didn\'t like the script as much as he thought he did but would go through with it anyway. The result is puppetry.',mixed
'The Green Inferno will be gleefully offensive and unpalatable to mainstream audiences, who may be more similar to The Green Inferno\'s victims than they\'d like to think. No one could accuse Roth of lacking guts \' even if he hasn\'t found the perfect recipe for them.',mixed
'Peet does it with a twinkle, finding class among the crass.',mixed
'The movie is often absorbing, and skillfully played, but, along with its snarling hero, it doesn\'t have much time for ordinary folk. By the end, like Marianne, we are left gasping for air.',mixed
'Beyond a few nice closing emotional beats, the whole enterprise plays too desperate and slapdash to whip up the goodwill required to sell such thin, far-fetched material.',mixed
'Ping-ponging camera moves temporarily distract from the haphazard structuring and translation.',mixed
'While Avery handles the kinetic action set-piece with impressive swagger for a first-timer, his self-penned screenplay is a major weak point.',mixed
'The gifted fantasy/sci-fi/horror specialist has made a film that\'s very bloody, and bloody stylish at that, one that\'s certainly unequaled in its field for the beauty of its camerawork, sets, costumes and effects. But it\'s also conventionally plotted and not surprising or scary at all, as it resurrects hoary horror tropes from decades ago to utilize them in conventional, rather than fresh or subversive ways',mixed
'There are some dumb thrills to be had but there is also the sense here of an ambition not quite realised.',mixed
'Angelo Pizzo knows inspirational sports drama. As the writer of \'Hoosiers\' and \'Rudy,\' Pizzo has made a career out of mining the genre and its themes of underdog determination and locker-room brotherhood. But he\'s overmatched in his directing debut, the well-intentioned football biopic My All American.',mixed
'The Ghost Dimension isn\'t exactly frightening \' the setup is so well-worn now that it\'s hard to be particularly startled by what transpires \' but it\'s able to wring sufficient dread out of this franchise\'s go-to fears.',mixed
'It does get mired in its obsession with its own style.',mixed
'The milieu \' coastal-industrial Australia \' is interesting, with its stoner arms dealers and crazed thugs of every age. But what sells Son of a Gun is McGregor\'s presence and performance, a guy using and mentoring a gullible but gutsy young man, trying to impart the wisdom of the wizened con to the kid.',mixed
'Don\'t get too excited: Not only is there nothing especially dirty about Dirty Weekend, the latest and lamest film by erstwhile provocateur Neil LaBute, but the movie doesn\'t even occupy an entire weekend.',mixed
'The film is too busy, and in some ways too gross, to sustain an effective atmosphere of dread. It tumbles into pastiche just when it should be swooning and sighing with earnest emotion.',mixed
'Mr. LaBute is not a moralizer as much as a lamenter \' his people usually bring unhappiness upon themselves. In the gently joyous Dirty Weekend, though, they are capable of finding a flight path to contentment.',mixed
'Never sure if it wants to be a hard-edged character drama or pacy action-thriller, Son Of A Gun has plenty to admire between the tonal wobbles.',mixed
'It\'s a shame that The Last Witch Hunter ends up crumbling into another generic showdown of murky fantasy effects and snatched artifacts, with a final shot that is literally framed around a door to possible sequels.',mixed
'Though there is heroism as well as love here, because it involves the deaths of people we have come to care about, Everest is finally a sad story, though not always a dramatically involving one.',mixed
'As Peter Pan should be one of the ultimate wish-fulfilment heroes for kids, it\'s baffling to see how he\'s been appropriated for such an awfully middling adventure.',mixed
'Hellions is art book horror, something to flip through but never truly eerie or scary.',mixed
'This is one of those cases where fictionalizing a true event, or at least fusing two or three real people into one composite character, might have resulted in tighter storytelling.',mixed
'In its favor, The Last Witch Hunter boasts some terrific production design and digital effects.... Less impressively, Eisner\'s movie is clogged with cardboard characters, flat dialogue and a sluggish middle act that gets lost in too much fabricated witchy folklore.',mixed
'Should well succeed in attracting their literally faithful audiences, although its heavy-handed proselytizing and soap opera-ish storytelling will prove a turn-off to those who don\'t pray on a daily basis.',mixed
'Narcopolis starts off intriguingly and ends solidly. It\'s everything else in between that isn\'t particularly compelling.',mixed
'Spectacular and well-acted, this suffers from much the same problem as the situation it depicts \' too many people on the mountain and too many threads to follow so that affecting individual stories get lost in the snow.',mixed
'How, then, does The Good German--adapted by Paul Attanasio from Joseph Kanon\'s novel--wind up so insubstantial, its impact lasting no longer than a cigarette?',mixed
'With a running time of 147 minutes, the film not only runs low on energy toward the end \' internecine battles can\'t compete with the early excitement of gifted young kids making it big on a national stage \' but turns ploddingly sentimental in its sudden focus on Eazy-E\'s painful decline, and death, from AIDS.',mixed
'Thin as a halfpenny, Victor Frankenstein has nothing to offer on science and the mysteries of creation, but it does reaffirm the grip that Shelley\'s story retains on the imagination, no matter how far afield it\'s taken.',mixed
'Everest, in short, suffers from the same problem as Everest: overcrowding.',mixed
'The Last Witch Hunter feels like the first episode of a would-be series although, unlike some similar endeavors, it tells a stand-alone story.',mixed
'Since the film is based on the Atari video game of the same name, it also has much to appeal to headbangers: fast pace, lots of gadgets, monsters, explosive special effects, plenty of inscrutable plot twists and turns.',mixed
'The Martian is ultimately a love letter to the spirit that saw humanity reach for the stars in the first place. When it\'s channelling that spirit via Damon and witty writing it lifts off, but then can\'t quite sustain its trajectory in orbit.',mixed
'The kind of movie you keep wishing would just cut loose and go off the deep end. Nobody goes to these Fatal Attraction retreads anymore for serious drama. But this one is a movie torn \' too grim and self-important to go truly nuts, but too silly and slipshod to work on a more somber level.',mixed
'If you\'re going to make an origin story, make an origin story. On second thought, if you\'re Joe Wright looking to tell us where Peter Pan and Captain Hook came from, maybe don\'t.',mixed
'It\'s extremely antic for the most part, covering a lack of real story with a lot of distracting quirk. Yet when Petit\'s foot slips out onto a wire thousands of metres from the ground, it\'s quietly mesmerising.',mixed
'It\'s disappointing and actually kind of cynical in its unwillingness to try anything even vaguely innovative with these beloved characters.',mixed
'Pre- credits, Date Movie runs a mere 70 minutes, which increasingly seems like seven minutes, repeated 10 times.',negative
'Look past its colorful, smooth surfaces and something corrosive emerges. And it\'s not like the film isn\'t aware of this. But it doesn\'t really know what to do with it.',negative
'The problem with Miss March is that it isn\'t very funny.',negative
'It\'s impossible to imagine why Lions Gate, the indie distributor that released Monster\'s Ball, would bother with this garbage.',negative
'It\'s certainly a moving tale.... Unfortunately, the film tells the story in the most prosaic fashion imaginable, missing nary a single faith-based film clich\' with its one-dimensional noble characters, banal dialogue and requisite sermonizing.',negative
'A witless undead retread served up as a vulgar revenge-of-the-dorks comedy.',negative
'It\'s just a matter of holding your nose until the whole thing is over.',negative
'Loud, repellent, badly written, indifferently directed and almost completely devoid of any genuine laughs, Scouts Guide to the Zombie Apocalypse is essentially a film for 12-year-old boys who can still derive some kind of basic entertainment for the mere sight of spurting blood or a bare breast, all the better if they can appear at the same time',negative
'The most shocking thing about Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension, is that four hacks fought to have their names listed in the credits under \'screenplay.\'',negative
'Miss March is overall a raggedy, unfocused affair that wastes both directors\' acting talent and feels like too much work between the laughs.',negative
'Lewd, crude, blessedly brief.',negative
'The meanest and least inspired kids U know.',negative
'The movie never bothers to show you life inside a shelter dormitory or tries to convey a broader vision of the city\'s street culture. It is too busy showcasing its star Jennifer Connelly (Mr. Bettany\'s wife) in degrading situations.',negative
'The film\'s larger points essentially fall by the wayside in the name of black comedy that\'s largely without genuine edge.',negative
'Awful and subversively spunky at the same time.',negative
'It\'s a grotesque, deadly dull piece of cinematic upchuck, a horror film minus tension or chills.',negative
'It\'s not awful, but the high cost of a movie ticket these days seems like a steep price to pay for 90 minutes of air conditioning and production design.',negative
'Exuberantly rude and crude, but generally more frantic than genuinely funny.',negative
'How bad is it? Let me count just some of the ways.',negative
'Pan is a cacophonous assault on the senses, all computerized cinematographic mayhem and deafening noise, and its hurried pace extinguishes any genuine character development.',negative
'Move over, Rudy. Hit the showers, Brian\'s Song. There\'s a new tearjerking true story of gridiron triumph, one that combines those male-weepie favorites in a way no focus group could possibly resist.',negative
'Supremely idiotic.',negative
'Deformed from the start, it confirms the very thing argued by its narrative \' namely, the folly of unwarranted resurrections.',negative
'That Les isn\'t one of LaBute\'s garden variety sadists is the best thing you can say about Dirty Weekend.',negative
'The blatantly misogynistic treatment of the female characters, who exist solely to service Rob and his best friend (Craig Roberts), would have felt retrograde in a movie made decades ago.',negative
'Chaos may not quite be the most brutal, horrifying film ever made, as its garish ads promote. But it does contain moments as thoroughly sickening as any in Herschell Gordon Lewis\' or Lucio Fulvi\'s bloody exploiters.',negative
'The faith-based War Room is so named because life is a battle to be strategized, with, in the case of God\'s infomercial of a film, a large bedroom closet serving as scripture-plastered command centre.',negative
'My All American offers viewers a thoroughly shameless hero piece.',negative
'The film has the requisite iconography of a crime thriller, but no investment in any of it.',negative
'If you thought Matthew Broderick looked uncomfortable playing \'himself\' in \'Trainwreck,\' wait till you get a load of the actor portraying a married man who wonders if he\'s gay in Neil LaBute\'s mean-spirited comedy Dirty Weekend.',negative
'This is definitely for people who 1) love the video game, 2) think Slater and Dorff are eminently watchable, no matter what bad flick they\'re in and 3) are wearing industrial-strength ear plugs.',negative
'The film compares the behavior of ravens and humans\'their similar tendencies to be protective, flock, and mate with others\'with an expectation that profundity and insight will come. When it doesn\'t, the film\'s emotions feel calculated, not earned.',negative
'Writer-director Eli Morgan Gesner (a clothing designer and skateboarder who previously helmed the skateboarding and hip-hop doc \'Concrete Jungle\') could have milked the premise for gleeful counterculture exploitation (like a 21st-century \'Basket Case\') or campy John Waters-style gross-out comedy, but settles for mean-spirited banality.',negative
'Vehicle for Dana Carvey as a chameleonic crime-fighting imbecile is noisy, colorful and fart-gag-filled enough to amuse undiscriminating auds under the age of 10.',negative
'Whatever drugs director Joe Wright may or may not have been on when he wrestled Pan to the ground, pulverizing the material into a quivering mound of monkey-bread dough, you can trust that they were synthetic. Not a single emotional moment in this entire origin story for J.M. Barrie\'s Peter Pan, Captain Hook, and Neverland feels organic.',negative
'The sixth time is not the charm with this load of hooey that tries to make up for its lack of legitimate scares or basic narrative clarity by adding the alleged miracle of 3-D into the mix.',negative
'Premature isn\'t nearly as inventive and witty as Groundhog Day or Edge Of Tomorrow about finding fresh angles on repeating events, and it overestimates how much the audience might care about the self-improvement of a bland, clueless douchebag.',negative
'A lowest common denominator spoof.',negative
'It\'s a shame that what could have been an intriguing situational thriller devolves into a hateful, arduous drag',negative
'To call it amateurish would be kind.',negative
'McAvoy\'s performance is a deep, deep shade of gonzo and by far the most enjoyable aspect of Victor Frankenstein \' you don\'t often see over-acting this enthusiastic or this flecked with spittle.',negative
'That this bit of pustulence is based on a video game of the same name is no surprise. It explains the thin plot, characters and abundant gunplay.',negative
'The only thing this so-called cautionary tale will inspire audiences to do is to never sit through another insultingly awful piece of exploitative trash conceived by David DeFalco.',negative
'Beyond its mere unfunniness and stupidity, Septic Man is criminally unimaginative.',negative
'Slackers is supposed to be a gross-out comedy, but the tastelessness of its jokes is nothing compared to its sheer cluelessness.',negative
'Hitman: Agent 47, much like its anonymous title, is a film pretending to be an action movie instead of the real thing. It might as well be a commercial. Or, hell, a video game.',negative
'With The Good German, Soderbergh -- generally a terrific and creative filmmaker -- apes a style, and a way of seeing, that he clearly doesn\'t understand. It feels like a hit to the stomach.',negative
'At best, The Green Inferno is a reliable shock and disgust-delivery system. At worst \' and it certainly veers toward the worst \' it\'s a racially reprehensible work that exploits one of the world\'s most powerless peoples. And no number of movie-geek references to \'Cannibal Holocaust\' is going to change that.',negative
'Amateurish, undramatic and bereft of any sense of pacing.',negative
'Bottom-feeding monstrosity of a comedy.',negative
'The movie \' which looks and sounds like a more brutal Bond knockoff \' is at least consistently stylish, though its tone is less assured.',negative
'Based on fact but mired in cliches, My All-American pays respectful tribute to U. of Texas football legend Freddie Steinmark (1949-71) with the sort of on-the-nose sincerity that transforms biography into hagiography',negative
'There are ticklish moments, but no real laughs.',negative
'The bad news is that it\'s also vile, not to mention sophomoric and unfunny.',negative
'Preachy doesn\'t begin to describe War Room, a mighty long-winded and wincingly overwrought domestic drama.',negative
'We\'re forced to listen to misogynistic rantings devoid of wit, entertainment value, or even authenticity.',negative
'United Passions leaves no historical-drama clich\' unexploited: the voiceover narration, the jumbled Europudding accents, the expository dialogue, the hasty compression of major world events, the thickly applied old-age makeup, the not remotely seamless mix of re-creations and archival footage. It\'s all there, in support of FIFA\'s lies.',negative
'It\'s time to start recognizing that not all escapist entertainment is created equal. And that some of it isn\'t even entertainment. Miss March is, to use the vernacular of the escapist moviegoer, the biggest pile of crap I\'ve seen in ages.',negative
'Like criticizing the light fixtures on the Titanic. This ship was going down anyway.',negative
'Nicely shot, atrociously written, shoutingly acted and intrusively scored (to classical selections and the heavy synth accompaniment of Fall on Your Sword), this roundelay of misery drowns itself in cliche after cliche.',negative
'Aggressively ugly and gross, the movie boasts a certain low-rent authenticity, but the auteur never figures out how to fill his grubby little rooms.',negative
'This needlessly vulgar exercise in overuse of the n-word bills itself as a comedy. Even the outtakes over the closing credits don\'t live up to that.',negative
'Nothing feels believable in \'Big Stone Gap,\' a bungled, charm-free look at small-town life in the South in the late \'70s.',negative
'Although this well-meaning film may appeal to its intended audience on a spiritual level, the result is a sluggish, clinical, largely dreary portrait that tends to mistake trauma for drama.',negative
'Reeks as badly as it sounds.',negative
'Just as dispiriting as its lack of scares (or sense of humor) is Septic Man\'s lack of purpose -- devoid of any commentary, the film pointlessly wallows around in the muck, thereby making itself as valuable as those nasty things routinely flushed down the toilet.',negative
'The most that can be said for Slackers -- aside from the unqualified pleasure of Schwartzman\'s unfaked, puppyish weirdness -- is that it doesn\'t abandon its putrid ideals for the sake of a neat finish.',negative
'Most of the humor is aimed at 14-year-olds.',negative
'A crass, witless knockoff of better films.',negative
'Insofar as Hitman: Agent 47 is about anything, really, it\'s about the pleasures of being on location \' from the gratuitous image of Ware taking a dip in a five-star-hotel swimming pool to the sight of Singapore\'s staggering Gardens by the Bay.',negative
'Boasting that your film features two of the six writers of Scary Movie, as this film\'s marketing campaign does, is like bragging that you came in second in the annual Bulwer-Lytton Bad Fiction Contest.',negative
'Even without the current headlines, United Passions is a disgrace. It\'s less a movie than preposterous self-hagiography, more appropriate for Scientology or the Rev Sun Myung Moon. As cinema it is excrement. As proof of corporate insanity it is a valuable case study.',negative
'The Green Inferno feels like a retread of a retread.',negative
'Hellions is unsettling, but in all the wrong ways.',negative
'Aaron Seltzer and Jason Friedberg, who wrote the screenplay, have crammed dozens of movie parodies into this deliberately juvenile spoof of romantic comedies. Mr. Seltzer, who directed, has made very few of them funny.',negative
'The real disappointment is Danny DeVito as a creepy coroner.',negative
'Strands one of the most gifted casts assembled in some time. Sadly, though many of the actors throw off a spark or two when they first appear, they can\'t generate enough heat in this cold vacuum of a comedy to start a reaction.',negative
'Largely inert and undramatic, what you\'re left with is a tedious sentiment: \'by the grace of god\' this horrible crisis ended without violence, explosives, or spark. Congratulations?',negative
'Once again, we have a movie where the jokes are aimed at the least common denominator - meaning that to genuinely enjoy the experience of sitting through Slackers, you will need help from a controlled substance.',negative
'I understand how hard it is for parents to find movies to take their kids to, but the thought of them or their children getting stuck at this stinker galls me. Summer vacation feels short enough as it is.',negative
'Hitman: Agent 47 is a film that bears nothing but a passing resemblance to the game that spawned it, but that shouldn\'t surprise anyone, as it\'s all just a cash grab, anyway. No choice but to wash, rinse, repeat: cha-ching.',negative
'Robert Lieberman\'s Perverted Justice advert spins its wheels with scene after scene impatiently cut like a montage sequence.',negative
'A smorgasbord of empty calories, the Vin Diesel vehicle The Last Witch Hunter, for all its overstuffed visuals, leaves you hungry. But not for more.',negative
'Amateurishly shot, written and acted, the film lacks any redeeming values to compensate for its horrific aesthetic.',negative
'A bleak, tedious enterprise, shot in earth tones and Gothic gray and blue.',negative
'Trying something different and playing around with convention is always commendable, but if The Reflektor Tapes proves anything, it\'s that the result can sometimes fail miserably.',negative
'At times, it actually hurts to watch.',negative
'About as endearing as unanesthetized gum surgery.',negative
'Just Tara-ble.',negative
'Small-screen comic talent is all over Fresno, with key players from series including Parks & Rec, Arrested Development and Portlandia teaming up for a tale of two sisters stuck with a hard-to-dispose-of dead body. The feature, sadly, exhibits none of the smarts or agility that fuel those series.',negative
'There\'s an opportunity here for screenwriter Marek Posival and director Robert Lieberman to play up the squeamishness of upper-middle-class torturers who don\'t fit the profile, but they\'re too busy tending to horror-thriller clich\'s.',negative
'Too campy to work as straight drama and too violent and sordid to function as comedy, Vulgar is, truly and thankfully, a one-of-a-kind work.',negative
'The trouble with Whipped isn\'t that its characters are dirty mouthed horndog jerks -- it\'s that they\'re phony dirty mouthed horndog jerks.',negative
'Empty cynicism isn\'t a substitute for well-reasoned critique, and Roth winds up looking more clueless than the so-called \'social justice warriors\' he\'s trying to satirize.',negative
'The film is measured and executed effectively to satiate horror fans\' bloodlust, yet its underlying messages are just so repugnant.',negative
'It\'s bluntly written, poorly shot and edited, and cruel without being clever.',negative
'The roll call of perversions and adolescent sex gags are more creepy than kooky and the sudden shift to triumphant romantic sincerity at the climax rings as false as this film\'s sappy (sorry, happy) ending.',negative
'A singularly distasteful campus romp.',negative
'You can get away with this sort of thing if your humor is sharp, but here it\'s mostly sophomoric and rarely surprising.',negative
'The simplifications and sanitizations of Brooklyn would be only dreary if they merely served the purpose of a streamlined and simplified story-telling mechanism. What renders them odious is the ethos that they embody, the worldview that they package.',negative
'This joyless, 10-megaton bomb fails in just about every imaginable way, as well as some you couldn\'t possibly imagine.',negative
'A confusedly misconceived hybrid of interracial buddy comedy and imitation Marx Brothers farce.',negative
'Way too bleak to be funny, even as a contemporary satire of the battle of the sexes.',negative
'The script\'s messy seams also show in the parade of sidekicks that passes through Kaulder\'s door as a new threat develops.',negative
'A sex comedy that appears to have been made by people who\'ve never actually had sex.',negative
'Dumb as dirt and just as generic, Hitman: Agent 47 trades brains for bullets and characters for windup toys.',negative
'Condescending, self-righteous and sloppy, Truth is simply a bad film for which there are no excuses.',negative
'For a horny-road-trip flick that\'s actually funny, check out last year\'s Sex Drive, which just came out on video.',negative
'There are worse movies, but that\'s no excuse. Rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment.',negative
'Watching The Last Witch Hunter is like sitting by while someone else plays a game whose coolness eludes us.',negative
'There\'s simply too much going on to establish characters.',negative
'A catastrophic miscalculation of a movie, Victor Frankenstein is a perfect example of a Hollywood revision that, in trying to outsmart an original, reveals what worked about said original in the first place.',negative
'By going exactly where you think it\'s going, Victor Frankenstein doesn\'t so much invent a fresh origins story as it essentially repeats, with a few uninteresting new details, all the same stuff we\'ve seen in the other 457 Frankenstein movies.',negative
'Writer-director-stars Zach Cregger and Trevor Moore, of the Whitest Kids U\'Know, here prove the crassest, most maladroit moviemakers you know.',negative
'At a time when it seems so many of the best film directors are moving over to television because the feature filmmaking process can\'t accommodate their artistic ambitions, this pompous, know-something-ish, navel-gazing, indulgent, pissy, priggish, albeit reasonably well-photographed, pile of sick got financed to completion. Because Among Ravens is, finally, a thoroughly noxious concoction.',negative
'The Singing Forest was written and directed by Jorge Ameer, whose film Strippers opened three years ago and remained the single worst movie I had ever reviewed -- until now.',negative
'I lodge no complaint against the film\'s emphasis on prayer, even if, dramatically, it\'s not scintillating stuff to watch.',negative
'The only thing shocking about it, however, is the degree to which self-congratulatory gutter exhibitionism has become the degraded ash end of indie \'\'edge.\'\'',negative
'To begin with, the very premise feels off. Peter Pan isn\'t a superhero and doesn\'t really need an origin story, especially one that opens at a London orphanage for boys during the Blitz and borrows heavily from the \'Oliver Twist\' handbook.',negative
'The plot is just high-tech Swiss Cheese, filled with holes and smelling like last week\'s refrigerator contents.',negative
'Gives stupid, vulgar comedy a bad name.',negative
'Even without the cloud of the recent disturbing developments, United Passions is a cringeworthy, self-aggrandizing affair that mainly benefits from its unintentional camp value.',negative
'Before immediately handing the movie an F and sending it off to summer school, give the filmmakers, and especially co-star Jason Schwartzman, credit for their anarchic willingness to try anything to shock a laugh loose from an audience.',negative
'I was consistently aghast at how unabashedly alpha-male, heartless, and chauvinistic this film is.',negative
'It often seems that \'Agent 47\' is more concerned with landscape, buildings, offices and subway stations than it is with characters. It\'s a lost cause and we lose interest long before we\'re shown the exotic architecture of Singapore.',negative
'No better than whatever you might pick up while wearing a blindfold at Blockbuster, even if you happen to reach into a trash can.',negative
'McAvoy and Radcliffe are actors with charm to burn, but it\'s only in brief moments that their characterizations cut through the film\'s pandemonium, while the jokes they\'re called upon to deliver land with a thud.',negative
'Longtime camera operator Stephen S. Campanelli\'s directorial debut is frustratingly by-the-book, with all the trappings of a movie marketed to rowdy fifteen-year-old boys.',negative
'The cast isn\'t bad but the movie is, and Amir\'s use of Holocaust imagery is cheap and unnecessary; Jo and Alexander could just as easily have died on the Titanic. At one point the dialogue is completely drowned out by the roar of the surf, and that is no doubt a blessing.',negative
'Grotesquely smutty and obnoxiously overbearing, this is a pitiful excuse for a comedy.',negative
'Bad movies can be a hoot, but rather than campy, Ameer appears to be dead serious; and it\'s hard to feel anything but fury toward a filmmaker whose opening title sequence intersperses black-and-white flashbacks of his sexy young lovers with actual concentration-camp photos of stacked, emaciated corpses.',negative
'This movie has straight-to-video written all over it.',negative
'Hitman: Agent 47 takes an austere European aesthetic and combines it with Hollywood mindlessness, and the result is like a guilty pleasure, minus the pleasure.',negative
'The intended charms of the down-home period piece/Southern comedy/romance/drama Big Stone Gap were utterly lost on me.',negative
'United Passions, with its clashing, production partner-mandated Europudding of accents, fails to find a unifying voice.',negative
'Careens helplessly between the garish and the generic.',negative
'One of a barely acknowledged sub-breed of indie: howling-vanity amateur-work.',negative
'So what do the tea leaves say? They\'re hard to read through the over-the-top grossness and weak acting, but it\'s probably that gentrification is good, poor people and assorted lowlifes don\'t deserve prime real estate, and Sean Penn\'s baby girl needs a better agent.',negative
'It\'s a chilling piece of legal hysteria, and ripe for nasty farce. But Pooh plays it all for buffoonish pratfalls and fart jokes.',negative
'Pierce Brosnan\'s charm and finesse haven\'t been put to good use since The Matador. That was years ago. Some Kind of Beautiful doesn\'t improve his luck at all.',negative
'An indie exercise in macho posturing disguised as a tale of grief, reminds us that losing one\'s parents is psychically debilitating. But that\'s about as useful as knowing that rain is wet.',negative
'An odd mix, to be sure, but full-tilt performances from Mara, as meth-addicted, widowed mom-cum-kidnappee Ashley Smith, and Oyelowo, playing the stone-cold killer turned cornered kidnapper Brian Nichols, help this spiritual thriller rise (very slightly) above other, more hamfisted, heaven-friendly fare.',negative
'So lazy and slipshod it confuses the mere flashing of kinky soft-core imagery with naughty fun.',negative
'In a memorably bad summer for children\'s films, this, surely, is as low as things can sink.',negative
'Inexplicably mixing lamer-than-lame bad taste comedy with yea worse traumatized-assault-victim histrionics, pic\'s only entertainment value lies in viewer weighing whether pic is primarily a.) offensive b.) amateurish c.) pathetic or d.) a cry for help.',negative
'Veering from ridiculous to revolting, The Tortured would like to be about more than singed nipples and seared skin. And it is: It\'s also about cracked toes and lanced eardrums.',negative
'A collection of throwaway gags from other movies, a big blue recycling barrel of comedy waiting for the trash collector. It\'s rated PG-13 because 13 is the maximum age of those who might find it funny.',negative
'First-time directors Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski must have written the script for this comedy when they were about 12--and not changed a word.',negative
'Its film school aesthetics and sophomoric storytelling are sense-deadening.',negative
'Profoundly depressing.',negative
'A fairly faithful adaptation of what a game is like, but without the pleasure of getting to play or the much-needed option of pressing the off button.',negative
'Earning the opposite of its intended effect, United Passions makes you believe we have yet to witness the true depths of FIFA\'s ego and arrogance.',negative
'Say one thing for these killer kids: they\'re creative.',negative
'Most of this is tedious instead of unintentionally amusing.',negative
'One of the worst films to sport the label \'romantic comedy.\'',negative
'Oyelowo and Mara achieve terrific chemistry. Perhaps they\'ll work together again \' in a better film.',negative
'A discordant comedy that gives bad taste a bad name.',negative
'Still, The Haunting these films are not.',negative
'By the time you\'re meant to learn just what the tie is between John and Louis, you\'ve stopped caring. But, thanks to the excellent if a little on the obviously-pictorial-side cinematography by Robert Barocci, you\'ve seen some lovely vistas on the way to indifference.',negative
'One can always keep praying that the next of these films will be a little better.',negative
'So inept on every level, you wonder why the distributor didn\'t release it straight to video, or better, toss it directly into the trash.',negative
'One way to get through Baby Geniuses is to think about whether it really is the worst movie you\'ve ever seen. Probably not, but pretty darn close.',negative
'Empty jokes hang heavy.',negative
'Mostly this happy train wreck feels like a longer, better movie that was chopped up and reassembled by retarded monkeys; what should have been a rush instead feels rushed.',negative
'Some Kind Of Beautiful has a fine cast, but they\'re stuck doing shtick.',negative
'It\'s a lazy, by-the-numbers bore.',negative
'A thoroughly unpleasant experience.',negative
'Quite an artful dissembler. Despite all evidence to the contrary, this clunker has somehow managed to pose as an actual feature movie, the kind that charges full admission and gets hyped on TV and purports to amuse small children and ostensible adults.',negative
'If you\'re not too undone by agitation with Carter\'s umpteenth quip about the female body, you may even work up a smile over some of these sweeter moments involving the uniformed trio.',negative
'Slackers depends on the pathetic Ethan and the flatulent Sam for most of its laughs, and both characters are more revolting than amusing.',negative
'The most joyless revisionism since Disney\'s The Lone Ranger.',negative
'For a movie that\'s all about camouflage, this sketch comedy epilogue turns out to be its most creative disguise: a thin coating of humor slapped on an otherwise ponderous film.',negative
'The flick is an artless, puerile shadow of the likes of Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg\'s Cornetto trilogy.',negative
'Roth amplifies that exploitation flick\'s least interesting components (gore, cruelty) at the expense of all others.',negative
'Much of what follows is turgid and, for non-believers, ridiculous.',negative
'Tedious, derivative exercise, stolen from a dozen or so horror/action films.',negative
'It\'s the first feature film for director Aleksander Bach, and he shares the blame with the pair of screenwriters. His creation is a muddled mess that is briefly lifted by some fun set pieces, but never is more impressive than a 108-minute Audi commercial.',negative
'The gags are mostly puerile and uninspired \' like the film was dreamed up by a bunch of tired, wired 13-year-olds; it has their insistence but little of their invention.',negative
'Vulgar doesn\'t begin to describe it: Try one of the foulest, least funny films ever made under the rubric of black comedy.',negative
'The hokey dialogue and witless physical gags keep everything painful and hectoring.',negative
'A gimmick in search of a movie: how to get Carvey into as many silly costumes and deliver as many silly voices as possible, plot mechanics be damned.',negative
'Momentum is a confused, bland, and wholly unoriginal action/thriller that tries its best to ripoff the mid-budget international action formula of Luc Besson\'s Europacorp productions.',negative
'The dominant emotion in Pan is the desperation of the filmmakers, who frantically try to pander to a young audience they don\'t seem to respect, understand or trust.',negative
'The movie\'s climactic exorcism jamboree provides some relief from the movie\'s overwhelming dullness, and the final segments put the movie\'s 3-D to use, but overall, Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension feels like the last wheeze of a played-out series.',negative
'Pants and wheezes and hurls itself exhausted across the finish line after barely 65 minutes of movie, and then follows it with 15 minutes of end credits in an attempt to clock in as a feature film.',negative
'Director Uwe Boll (House of the Dead) has made a cottage industry out of this kind of junk. Maybe it\'s time for him to close up shop.',negative
'One of those rare instances of a movie being so bad ... it\'s still really bad.',negative
'The film by the stylish fantasist Guillermo del Toro looks marvelous, but has a vein of narrative muck at its core.',negative
'A turkey with all the trimmings.',negative
'Premature, you will be exhausted to hear, is a teen sex comedy with the plot of Groundhog Day, its supernatural comedy hearkening more to Scott Baio\'s Zapped! than to Porky\'s.',negative
'Victor Frankenstein is misshapen as the bad doctor\'s creature itself, straining without wit or viscera to be a devilish horror romp.',negative
'A horrible, horrible film that wears out its welcome before its opening credits.',negative

'Victor Frankenstein is, despite bravura performances from committed young leads Daniel Radcliffe and James McAvoy, all kinds of obnoxious and pointless.',negative
'An awful, stillborn comedy assembled out of rusty spare parts from secret agent movies and run-of-the-mill \'\'Saturday Night Live\'\' skits.',negative
'A retread of such brainless, shameless lameness that it\'s hard to imagine anyone begging for another installment.',negative
'Anti\'romantic comedy Some Kind of Beautiful starts with a dialogue scene that baldly explains to viewers what kind of casually chauvinistic narrative it\'s not going to be. That promise is gracelessly and repeatedly broken thanks to neophyte screenwriter Matthew Newman\'s clich\'d characterizations and helmer Tom Vaughan\'s incompetent direction.',negative
'Not a moment of Sinister 2 is convincing or frightening.',negative
'Whipped is cinematic suicide, if not for actor, then certainly for audience.',negative
'Victor Frankenstein is the movie version of a carnival sideshow, all smoke and mirrors, presenting a litany of human freaks and animal monstrosities to distract from the superficiality of its psychological and intellectual concerns.',negative
'An embarrassingly unscary monster mash, is desperate to frighten its laughing audience any way it can.',negative
'While Remar does his best to resist the film\'s melodramatic tendencies \' to no avail, ultimately \' Thompson is the only one here who actually grounds the proceedings during his few moments on screen.',negative

'There\'s certainly an audience for these thrillers, but imagine how big that audience might be for one that really works.',negative
'As bad as the title, and much longer.',negative
'Blanchett, as you\'d imagine, is riveting, even when she\'s saddled with the movie\'s on-the-nose dialogue, not to mention a handful of fairly contrived domestic scenes.',negative
'A black comedy that never gets black enough to inspire Farrelly-style decadence.',negative
'A shit stain on the genre.',negative
'Only Quaid, as a semiretarded horny robot, and Cleese as a fussy chauffeur hologram seem to get it. Even Murphy, as the titular nightclub big shot in outer space, forgets to be actually funny until the climax.',negative
'Chaos lacks the audience-implicating boldness or howling political outrage of that landmark (Wes Craven\'s Last House on the Left); where Last House was provocative, Chaos is merely disgusting.',negative
'Completely forgettable, Hellions is far less cool, smart, and scary than it thinks it is.',negative
'Here\'s the deal: The worst sex cartoon in Playboy\'s long history can\'t compete with the sheer vacuousness of this inane comedy.',negative
'Bad films are easy to make, but a film as unpleasant as Baby Geniuses\' achieves a kind of grandeur.',negative
'Nothing about Sinister 2 comes close to the feel-bad ode to literally and figuratively dark interiors that distinguished the title-earning original.',negative
'Awkwardly staged and edited and fitted out with an overly intrusive score drawn primarily from classical music, the film consistently subverts the earnest efforts of its cast.',negative
'One of the most egregiously awful horror films in recent memory.',negative
'Ugly. ..and unpleasant -- and clueless on a grand scale.',negative
'Robinson is hilarious, at least in the early going. Sadly, Robinson is all that stands between Miss March and complete worthlessness.',negative
'In terms of execution this movie is careless and unfocused.',negative
'Latenight cable TV filler disguised as a feature film.',negative
'A decent idea for a low-budget movie that never gets past the idea stage, and after a brief while, you may start to question whether it should have been a movie at all, much less a 90-minute one.',negative
'A hodgepodge of horny-old-man clich\'s writ large, staged as a gleeful affirmation of its male lead\'s ego and entitlement.',negative
'A disregard for the rules established by George Romero (or the alternatives imagined by Danny Boyle) is far from the only problem with Christopher Landon\'s film, which does prove one thing fairly handily: Even beings deprived of the intellect and spirit granted to living humans can team up to produce a major studio motion picture.',negative
'It\'s just a clumsily written, flatly-acted sermon built on some of the same stereotypes that made Tyler Perry rich.',negative
'You\'ve got to give Norm Macdonald credit. When he cheats his audience, he warns them first.',negative

'Hands-down, the best James Brolin-in-an-Italian-accent movie ever.',negative
'James Purefoy (\'The Following\') makes a pretty decent bad guy. Olga Kurylenko (\'The Water Diviner\') is passable as an action heroine. Neither of those facts makes Momentum any fun to sit through, crammed as it is with leaden dialogue and predictable plot turns.',negative
'Director Eisner helmed the excellent remake of George R. Romero\'s The Crazies back in 2010, but this film shows none of the lunatic flair for the ghastly that the previous film so easily served up.',negative

'Hang out at a frat house or sports bar, and you can hear this kind of talk for free.',negative

'Alone in the Dark will be the worst movie of 2005. The idea that anything could be worse is the only genuine scare the movie has to offer.',negative
'There may well be new and novel ways to spark audience shivers from not-so-bright homeowners inexplicably using their cameraphones to check out bumps in the night, but this series clearly has neither the patience nor the inclination to look for them anymore.',negative
'Among Ravens claws itself to death with sophomoric symbolism.',negative
'A disappointing venture. If only it had been more clever, perhaps darker.',negative
'The gags are familiar collegiate stuff, involving horny young men, horny old whores -- horny young tramps -- silly foreigners, uptight authority figures, homosexuals and sassy fat women.',negative
'The proper mix is never found. Ill-conceived and expensive project that winds up looking like a bunch of talented thesps slumming it.',negative
'Puerile bluster.',negative
'Even if the title is meant to be ironic, the latest from writer-director Neil LaBute is a frustratingly stilted vision of middle-aged repression unleashed.',negative
'It\'s kind of amazing that a joke-a-second comedy like Date Movie doesn\'t contain a single laugh.',negative
'As the straight-man virgin, Cregger is almost entirely devoid of personality; as his hyperkinetic sidekick, Moore may have the most unlikable personality in movie history.',negative
'An odd little movie. And not in a good way.',negative

'Sinister 2 has so little connection to the first film (save for the home movies) that if you see enough horror movies, you will strain to recall the original.',negative
'There\'s no attempt to convince us that the world is being corrupted by people who haven\'t accepted the Gospel; it merely assumes we agree with that idea.',negative
'Among Ravens wants to be the The Big Chill with Gen-X assholes, a weird ambition.',negative
'It\'s McHattie\'s bizarre turn as the beleaguered town\'s mayor that steals this show. Taking his cue from another infamous Ontario public servant, he gives a performance that can only be described as bat-shit crazy. Fitting, eh?',negative

'As if the ravings of a lunatic weren\'t dull enough, Septic Man eventually becomes the ravings of an idiot too.',negative
'The film\'s so inflated with moral importance that it becomes ridiculous, a Lifetime movie shoved into a cage and fattened with sermons and platitudes until it is ready to be served up cold and bland.',negative
'Go see this movie and you\'ll be...yup. You should save your money; Norm Macdonald should save his career, by quitting movies altogether.',negative
'Ill-conceived from any number of angles, this Peter Pan origin story, scripted by Jason Fuchs (Ice Age: Continental Drift), plays topsy-turvy with J.M. Barrie\'s beloved characters.',negative
'Could have afforded to be a little loftier and still be quite funny. Instead, it\'s a waste.',negative
'Bare-bones vanity project.',negative
'A film so family-safe it feels sheathed in plastic Bubble Wrap. Unfortunately, it\'s not even as much fun as popping the bubbles. It doesn\'t matter that the film is less than 90 minutes. It still feels like a prison stretch.',negative
'A dirty movie. Not a sexy, erotic, steamy or even smutty movie, but a just plain dirty movie. It made me feel unclean, and I\'m the guy who liked There\'s Something About Mary and both American Pie movies.',negative
'Interspersed between the misogyny and flatulence jokes apparently left over from Pooh\'s co-written script for Friday, there\'s a story about an ex-con.',negative
'For much of the movie\'s running time, I wished I were watching Mel Brooks\' classic take on Shelley\'s yarn, Young Frankenstein. At least that one was intentionally funny.',negative
'The thin story has been stretched like Silly Putty to feature-film length and the result is utterly see-through in its sledgehammer moralizing.',negative
'Sure to appear in everyone\'s worst-of lists at year\'s end, to say nothing of a few bad dreams, Bryan Johnson\'s Vulgar is an unclassifiably awful study in self- and audience-abuse.',negative
'The story bores you to tears until it takes its tragic turn.',negative
'The characters\' marginalized social standing is less indicative of a real-life epidemic and more akin to window dressing.',negative
'This is a movie that is confident in clean living, blinkered righteousness, and manly sentimentality, and it is shamed by some brief footage of the real Freddie at the end, an actual person whose story has been diminished by this slack, dawdling, offensive film.',negative
'Not only is Slackers painfully bad, but it\'s also about as morally unpleasant as a teen sex comedy can be.',negative
'This is a sloppy hash of a movie, poorly directed and plotted in a way that looks as if it were improvised on the spot.',negative
'Rather than engage in slow-build horror, Pascal Trottier\'s screenplay flips the switch into Poultergeisty chaos.',negative
'This is bad. Not bad in a way that it might be fun to see when inebriated. Bad in a way from which only death provides immunity.',negative
'A perfect example of how lame, lazy material strands good actors, resulting in a movie that looks great and feels less so.',negative
'Arguably the lamest of all the free-wheeling genre parodies that have taken flight since Airplane!, Date Movie is stupefyingly unfunny in its attempts to mock romantic comedies, celebrities, reality TV shows and anything else that pops into the heads of its creators.',negative
'Alas, Slackers sucks. It\'s so bad Schwartzman can\'t save it, though he tries mightily; a flash of nudity from Pearl Harbor babe and male-named model-turned-actress James King isn\'t even worth the price of a video rental down the line.',negative
'Formulaic and deeply unfunny.',negative
'Writer Simon Fuchs begins with a reasonable idea \' we\'re all likely to be curious about the origins of Peter Pan \' and does unreasonable things ever after.',negative
'If Persecuted wasn\'t such a dire thriller, its sweaty fear of pluralism (Obama\'s \'We are no longer a Christian nation\' speech gets handed to Davison\'s evil senator here) might at least be amusing.',negative
'Far be it from me to dismiss a man\'s effort (Uwe Boll) in a sentence, but the film on your teeth after a three-day drunk possesses more cinematic value.',negative

'Revolting exploitation feature.',negative
'The tedium makes us forget the cynicism.',negative
'Hitman: Agent 47 is a by-the-numbers schlock action sequel that writes its own epitaph when a character mutters the dusty insult, \'You\'re dead, too. You just don\'t know it yet.\'',negative
'A treadmill sex comedy, huffing and puffing in place until its time is up.',negative
'Hitman: Agent 47 is aggressively awful, the kind of film that rubs its lackadaisical screenwriting, dull filmmaking and boring characters in your face, almost daring you to ask the theater operator for your money back.',negative
'Even McAvoy\'s reincarnation-obsessed Frankenstein can\'t breathe vitality into this shallow adaptation, which careens from moments of horror to serious drama to attempts at comedy that don\'t quite land.',negative
'The aim here seems to be to replace startled gasps with shocked guffaws. The results are contrary to Scout Law \' not Kind, Clean or Reverent.',negative
'Every key plot turn is telegraphed at least twice, just in case you missed it the first time. Every emotional moment in the movie is foreshadowed a few beats in advance by the manipulative musical score.',negative
'It\'s just the most inept filmmaking you can catch in theatres right now, or probably all year long.',negative
'Director Uwe Boll (House of the Dead) pulls off a nicely staged fistfight in an open-air market at the start, but soon loses his way amid mind-glazing exposition and endless gunfire aimed at bulletproof giant lizards.',negative
'Jack\'s predicament is both revolting and claustrophobic, but he never emerges as any kind of hero or villain, just a passive victim, which makes the pic\'s most off-putting quality its endless tedium.',negative
'Chaos is ugly, nihilistic, and cruel -- a film I regret having seen. I urge you to avoid it.',negative
'A rather dull and talkative comedy about two mismatched colleagues trapped in Albuquerque for a day of true confessions and misbehavior.',negative
'It\'s only in the late going that the marital drama turns somewhat more authentic, helping to restore a bit of the audience\'s, well, faith.',negative
'Perhaps there is a more excruciatingly painful and self-abusive way to spend 82 minutes. But I honestly can\'t think of what it would be.',negative
'Featuring unlikeable characters, preposterously contrived plotting, ham-fisted dialogue and strained attempts at poeticism, Among Ravens is a misfire on every level.',negative
'Eddie Murphy\'s latest comedy, The Adventures of Pluto Nash, takes place in the year 2087, which is about the earliest he can hope to be forgiven.',negative
'Hitman: Agent 47 is tedious, soulless and, for a film with a relatively trim runtime, seemingly never-ending.',negative
'The acting tends toward the cartoonish (not in a good way), and the story is built on a series of illogical motivations.',negative
'Blanchett\'s performance is Soderbergh\'s biggest mistake. He either encourages or permits her to play Lena as a Greta Garbo caricature, which is mildly amusing if you\'re interested in Garbo, but if you\'re interested in Lena and The Good German, you\'re out of luck.',negative
'Here is the horror-action genre at its silliest and most uninspired.',negative
'Lacking even a hint of humor or a watchable story, Disguise has distinguished itself as the summer\'s worst movie.',negative
'First-time director Bryan Johnson\'s failure to resolve the film?s two moods -- psychopathic sexual brutality and light social satire -- proves fatal.',negative
'Sheridan proves he can still act the crap out of a movie, even when crap is all the movie has to offer.',negative
'Tobey Maguire, terribly miscast and squeaky (that voice - it belongs to a kid!).',negative
'The best thing you can say about The Perfect Guy is that it plays out like a gelded version of Fatal Attraction, lacking anything dark or dangerous. It plays it too safe, and who wants a guy like that?',negative
'Featuring a non-stop barrage of gross-out effects depicting the substances that its title would indicate, this low-brow horror film is mainly suitable for audiences desperately pining for yet another Toxic Avenger sequel.',negative
'A criminally slow, all-but-laughless blaxploitation comedy.',negative
'Unbelievably awful celluloid-waster.',negative
'With no clear purpose in telling the story and no real focus in the actual storytelling, Pan never gets off the ground.',negative
'It\'s an exploitation film that never gets its audience off, even with cheap thrills \' what a dud.',negative
'The choice is yours: Shell out 10 bucks for this dire spoof of recent romantic comedies a la Scary Movie and Not Another Teen Movie, or toss your 12-year-old nephew a quarter and get him to act out scenes from his favorite movies for 80 minutes: The entertainment value will be about the same.',negative
'Seemingly every time there was an opportunity to do something fun, The Last Witch Hunter runs in the other direction, creating an unfortunately heavy-handed, humorless, self-serious tone for a story that should be allowed to be a little goofy.',negative
'The Lord works in mysterious ways but Persecuted works in blundering, obvious ways, straining a Christianity-under-attack theme through a dopey thriller.',negative
'Despite Mr. Ransone\'s goofy charm, Sinister 2 can\'t claim the same finesse, substituting pedestrian plotting and a more graphic gore for the original\'s restraint.',negative
'A misconceived roundelay that crosses the thin line dividing gross-but-funny from just plain gross.',negative
'The director was Baltasar Korm\'kur, a gifted filmmaker from Iceland who shouldn\'t be blamed for a case of industrial filmmaking gone wrong \' the culprits in elaborate clunkers like this are usually the producers and the studios.',negative
'Date Movie, alas, is here to remind us that slapstick can be just plain bad. These are sight gags best appreciated with a blindfold.',negative
'A confused and confusing thriller.',negative
'So mind-blowingly horrible that it teeters on the edge of cinematic immortality.',negative
'Boasting the canny use of suitably atmospheric, futuristic-looking locations, Narcopolis is far more impressive visually than narratively, with its tangled film noir plot making Raymond Chandler seem straightforward by comparison.',negative
'There are two main obstacles to enjoying The Last Witch Hunter. One is your ability to buy Vin Diesel as an immortal slayer of evildoers plying his trade in today\'s Manhattan. You also have to swallow a by-the-numbers plot buried under an avalanche of fast-and-furious but underwhelming CGI effects.',negative
'The individual scenes are just random, uninspired riffs by Carvey or awkwardly flat cameos by the likes of Jesse Ventura and Olympic sprinter Michael Johnson.',negative
'Slackers is, well, consummately cheesy. Ugh.',negative
'The movie mostly plays so strained and corn pone that it undermines its sincere emotional core and good intentions.',negative
'As repellent as their characters are, one feels a degree of pity for the three male leads, who give fresh evidence that hungry actors can\'t say no to a studio feature, no matter how humiliating the script.',negative
'This picture is just shapeless and shrill. It\'s disposable, forgettable and aimed at an audience that doesn\'t care.',negative
'Painfully unfunny and misguided to boot.',negative
'Watching Bill Murray go through the same scenario over and over is one thing. Experiencing the same feeble dick jokes over and over is another.',negative
'Bruce McDonald\'s Hellions is an unpleasant muddle of the visceral and the abstract.',negative
'If first-timer Aleksander Bach\'s choices as a director are any indication, he\'s a filmmaker who cares less about characters and actors than about dubious surface dazzle.',negative
'Writers Skip Woods and Michael Finch have a few tricks up their sleeves as betrayals emerge and allegiances shift. But it\'s not enough to make us care or to keep the third act from being a head-scratching mess.',negative
'No one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through The Master of Disguise, an unbearably tedious and unfunny comedy.',negative
'With one senseless set piece after another, the film\'s eponymous forward movement should carry it out of theaters quickly, notwithstanding the brief presence of a slumming Morgan Freeman in a role that might well have been shot in half a day.',negative
'It\'s a test of one\'s tolerance for watching predominantly empty frames \' the anonymous performers scarcely count \' in the hope something will jolt us from mounting tedium.',negative
'A stupid comedy with toddlers talking like hip \'90s grown-ups.',negative
'Brain-dead adaptation of a popular video game.',negative
'Enjoying this rancid slab of red meat depends not just on an appetite for slop, but also a taste for sloppy leftovers.',negative
'Trying to encapsulate the movie\'s storyline is not possible; it doesn\'t appear to have one.',negative
'A dumb and sloppy movie.',negative
'Provides scant entertainment value, intentional or otherwise.',negative
'The movie doesn\'t so much extend Schwartzman\'s antic outsider persona from \'\'Rushmore\'\' as uglify it, reducing him to the ultimate Uncool Anti-WASP.',negative
'Imagine combining bad imitations of the Ace Ventura and Austin Powers movies and you\'ll have a rough idea of this feeble Dana Carvey farce.',negative
'The movie is so inept - with its flat characters, histrionic acting, dull dialogue (Killing him is not going to change anything), a dreadfully overdone musical score and la-la-la flashbacks starring the kid - that its clich\'s grow slightly funny. But not funny enough to make the endless torture scenes bearable.',negative
'This un-terrifying film tries to find an interesting twist on the classic Frankenstein tale, but horrifically fails.',negative
'A thoroughly misguided, unfunny film that proves you shouldn\'t beat a dead horse.',negative
'Momentum is a spectacularly generic action-thriller that, despite its sleekly shot and edited mayhem, lands with a giant thud.',negative
'From laughs to smarts to a credible interest in rehabilitation, lovers of love would do better to go see Trainwreck again.',negative
'Comedy is hard, said Steve Martin. For the writers of Date Movie, it\'s apparently impossible.',negative
'Feels like a very long late-night comedy sketch that occasionally veers beyond tastelessness toward something worse.',negative
'Strict adherence to the playbook may work in sports, but My All American shows the pitfalls of that approach with movies.',negative
'For a story whose appeal hinges on the saving grace of getting a purpose-driven life, this one\'s got remarkably little of it.',negative
'Miraculously seems a great deal longer (this is not a good thing) as it careens from shit joke to corpse joke to ass joke to dog-turd joke and back.',negative
'Finish your popcorn early if you\'re going to The Green Inferno, and save the bucket to barf in.',negative
'It\'s all as pointless as the asthma inhaler with which one character treats his advanced lung cancer.',negative
'The Good German is just stiff. When Soderbergh tries one of those patented swoop-in-on-the-diagonal moves at a key dramatic moment, the effect is comic. And at that precise moment, the story starts dying a slow, oxygen-deprived death.',negative
'Director Khalil Sullins\' movie has its heart and brain in the right place, but its guts are a mess.',negative
'The worst movie of 1999.',negative
'A disjointed film that, but for brief flashes of comedic verve, should skip theatrical release and go straight to video.',negative
'So patchy in its laughs, so calculated in its grossness and so lacking in genuine comic exuberance, it makes you look at Road Trip in an admiring new light.',negative
'Too lazy to play your own d--- video game? Lucky for you there\'s horror director-for-hire Uwe Boll, who\'s making a career out of adapting successful Atari and Sega games into tedious popcorn fare that\'s the ultimate in cinematic passivity.',negative
'Cosmic slop.',negative
'Even a 15-year-old boy would find this movie to be a chore.',negative
'Even at this late stage in the evolution of the franchise, logical lapses in filmmaking technique undercut the integrity of the found-footage format.... What may be less acceptable, however, is the film\'s unaccountably weak effort to sort out the mythology concerning the series of demonic hauntings.',negative
'Breaks new ground both as an abominable enterprise in guy-talk and as no-budget hackwork.',negative
'Johnson does seem to have some psycho-sexual ax to grind amid all this visual and sexual crudity. For instance, women barely figure in the action, with Will taking on various stereotypical feminine attributes. But good luck finding meaning in all this mess.',negative
'Joseph winds up with an disorganized mishmash of visual gimmicks, empty exoticism, and soundbites worthy of \'This is Spinal Tap.\' Great music and some dynamic, up-close concert footage gives it the occasional life, but The Reflektor Tapes will appeal to Arcade Fire devotees only and even their patience might be tested.',negative
'This anemic genre parody from two of the six writers of Scary Movie strives for the goofball precision of the brothers Zucker and, long before it reaches the end of its 70-odd minutes, gives you newfound respect for the comic genius of the brothers Wayans (two of the other writers of Scary Movie).',negative
'A nasty piece of work that\'s been hanging around for two years looking for an audience.',negative
'It merely exudes an aura of cheap manipulation by which the audience is simply asked to rank the film\'s characters on a d-bag scale and root for their survival, or destruction, accordingly.',negative
'Cheesy, amateurish film.',negative
'Clumsy on every level.',negative
'The only thing remotely resembling parody in this depressing waste of time and money is Jennifer Coolidge\'s sendup of Barbra Streisand as an over-the-top string of Jewish mother clich\'s.',negative
'There are certainly enough dopey diversions here for The Last Witch Hunter to be considerably more fun than it is, but even its most extravagant bouts of silliness are hampered by desultory plotting and Eisner\'s oppressively synthetic mise-en-scene.',negative
'The laughs are few, far between and pretty darn faint in this comedy.',negative
'You\'re left with no real catharsis \' religious or emotional. And without that, Captive winds up building to a big nothing.',negative
'A loathsome shocker... Watching it almost turned my stomach.',negative
'Writer-director David DeFalco\'s ugly, pointless and dishonest remake of Craven\'s remake.',negative
'Stinks like a cat box that hasn\'t been changed in a hundred years.',negative
'It\'s just deadly and dreadful, loud and obnoxious, convoluted and irritating, horrible and dumb.',negative
'Date Movie has enough laughs to make rambunctious dudes hoot and holler, but not nearly enough to ensure the happy ending it promises.',negative
'What fun there is falls to Jackman, who gives the grand old man of pirate characters plenty of fresh and unusual wrinkles and emerges better than the others simply by virtue of playing a two-dimensional, rather than one-dimensional, figure.',negative
'There\'s scant character development, pedestrian dialogue, and an almost complete lack of humor.',negative
'For all its shocks and wannabe-disturbing imagery (trapped Bible-thumpers being mauled by rats etc.), nothing in Sinister 2 comes across as believably scary.',negative
'For all its cheap talk about the importance of innovation, Agent 47 just feels like a copy of a copy of a copy.',negative
'While his images have been composed with care, Nelson\'s screenplay is a far less impressive invention.',negative
'Even the rare individual who died laughing while watching the trailer will discover that only half of that phrase - the dying part - applies to the experience of enduring the film.',negative
'Even Boll seems to lose interest as the story unravels. By that time, the supernatural cliches, plot inconsistencies, dead ends and red herrings have piled up so high you can barely see the screen.',negative
'Save for a few inspired moments (usually at the expense of the city of Fresno), Jamie Babbit\'s screwball comedy is cringe-inducing and unfunny. Everyone in front of the camera here deserves better, particular Judy Greer in a rare starring role.',negative
'A complete washout, a joyless, pointless and fundamentally idiotic enterprise.',negative
'It\'s clear that Roth was trying to say something about the brave new world of social media-enabled social justice, and public shame as a tool for change, but the message is garbled. That it comes wrapped in a horror package that just isn\'t truly scary or suspenseful is the real shame though.',negative
'Elapsed time before I walked out: 29 minutesTotal laughs (in that period): 0',negative
'Pan doesn\'t deliver on its own promise. The movie doesn\'t so much enhance our understanding of the flying boy as it demonstrates how little thought went into crafting his back story.',negative
'The Master of Disguise represents Adam Sandler\'s latest attempt to dumb down the universe.',negative
'Murphy slogs his way through this dismally dull sci-fi comedy.',negative
'United Passions is one of the most unwatchable films in recent memory, a dishonest bit of corporate-suite sanitizing that\'s no good even for laughs.',negative
'Only a moron would expect a dude road-trip-sex comedy to be more than an aggressive expression of male sexual anxiety. But really, when did women become such vile creatures.',negative
'If all-out headache-nausea-braindeath is what you crave, Whipped\'s available.',negative
'Slater narrates as if reading a restaurant menu. Reid seems to have learned each long sentence in segments, so she wouldn\'t be overtaxed.',negative
'A standard issue undergrad gross-out comedy notable only for the showy role it provides Jason Schwartzman, well-remembered as Rushmore\'s geeky high school student Max Fischer.',negative
'Rendering a miraculous premise dull, the film seems relatively uninterested in doing more than preaching to the choir.',negative
'A mean-spirited farce whose strenuous bad taste seldom translates into actual laughs.',negative
'At a time when the world offers us no shortage of examples of what actual religious persecution looks like, for a film to indulge in this particular brand of self-righteous fearmongering isn\'t just clueless or reckless; it\'s an act of contemptible irresponsibility.',negative
'Just as the book is usually better than the film, one suspects the video game is probably more entertaining and coherent than the movie. In the case of Alone in the Dark, this is a certainty.',negative
'It may not be as brazenly offensive as \'God\'s Not Dead\' or as spectacularly inept as \'Kirk Cameron\'s Saving Christmas,\' but it\'s still awful, offering all the forced humor and superficial substance of a half-baked homily.',negative
'A caustic, raunchy, often hilarious examination of how men use women.',negative
'This abortion of a thriller fails, utterly, and bombed completely. So even though there\'s a \'Witch Hunter 2\' in development, don\'t count on it.',negative
'A lame pastiche of Hollywood romances.',negative
'A headache-inducing mess without direction or purpose.',negative
'Features amateurish acting and direction, and a going-nowhere script.',negative
'The Peanuts Movie is a sloppy mash-up of disconnected vignettes and rehashed jokes, all lazily reverse-engineered from the premise that a Peanuts movie is a thing that people will like and will happily pay to see.',negative
'Lean, nasty, and patently absurd, The Tortured plays like one long scream of agony.',negative
'The Green Inferno offers up extreme gore, unlikable characters and seriously confused themes (is it a pro-environment film, an ode to imperialism, a satire of social-justice warriors or a poorly sketched combination of all three?).',negative
'A horror-comedy that takes a weak premise (do high school boys even go scouting anymore?) and barely uses it, anyway.',negative

'A better title would\'ve likely been \'121 Minutes in Purgatory,\' since that\'s essentially where audiences will find themselves residing during the entirety of this dreary slog down a familiar road paved with painfully good intentions.',negative
'Certainly, it\'s gross, and maybe even a bit shocking, but these filmmakers are smart enough to realize that raising the bar on crassness in teen sex comedies is a zero sum game.',negative
'Unlike his father, Gotham Chopra is more interested in his own latent daddy issues than with questions of cosmic import.',negative
'Addicted to Fresno is such a mean-spirited, dull and silly movie that it buries its talented cast under the weight of a horrendous script that they can\'t possibly redeem.',negative

'The only thing about Victor Frankenstein worthy of praise is the set design. Visually, the movie is impressive but pretty pictures are better left to postcards.',negative
'Date Movie is a good date movie in one sense: If you\'re still speaking to the person who brought you to see this, you just might have a future together.',negative
'Three strikes maybe, but no stars and no thumbs up (except the one way, way up its own ass).',negative
'As it stands, it\'s one of the worst films you won\'t see in 2015.',negative
'It takes a really bad stupid comedy to make you appreciate well-done stupid comedies. And boy is Miss March a stupid comedy.',negative
'The not so fair and balanced film might have made its religious themes palatable if it worked reasonably well as a thriller. But director/screenwriter Lusko shows no flair for the genre, his muddled execution lacking any sense of pacing or suspense.',negative
'Despite some scenic territory, there\'s just not much to this journey, leaving Lost in the Sun feeling like a short story stretched way too thinly toward feature length.',negative
'A rapidly wearying comedy that mistakes crudeness with humor.',negative
'Plunges into an abyss of gruesome imagery so repulsive it precludes further watching.',negative
'The screenplay is so clunky, not a single cast member manages to sound believable. Familiar, likable actors from Kate Bosworth to Gina Carano to Morris Chestnut are buried under an avalanche of awful. You\'ve been warned.',negative
'As propaganda, United Passions is as subtle as an anvil to the temple. As drama, it\'s not merely ham-fisted, but pork-shouldered, bacon-wristed, and sausage-elbowed.',negative
'As vapidly generic as its title, British director Scott Mann\'s Heist is a by-the-numbers crime thriller that squanders a decent cast, including Robert De Niro, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Dave Bautista.',negative
'But even Carvey\'s protean talent can\'t dent this ponderously unfunny and uninspired comedy. It\'s hard to imagine anyone older than 10 being diverted by its broad buffoonery, and kids deserve better than this in the first place.',negative
'While 90 Minutes In Heaven has a professional sheen miles above the clunky products peddled by PureFlix (God\'s Not Dead) and their ilk, that just makes it duller.',negative
'From first frame to last, \'Some Kind of Beautiful\' is some kind of hideous, a perfect storm of romantic-comedy awfulness that seems to set the ailing genre back decades with the sheer force of its ineptitude.',negative
'Barely proficient on a craft level, this jumble of putatively comic misunderstanding and overly familiar crude burlesque achieves its nadir with a cameo from Mamie Van Doren, a degrading, shameful turn that lays bare, all too literally, the filmmakers\' contempt for women.',negative
'This terrible attempt at a political thriller for the religious right is aimed not at Christians in general but at a certain breed of them, the kind who feel as if the rest of the world were engaged in a giant conspiracy against their interpretation of good and truth.',negative
'Joe Wright\'s origin story of Peter and the lost boys has to be the dimmest, deadliest take ever on J.M. Barrie\'s Pan myth.',negative
'So, Bobby, seriously, what the hell is happening? You got a new movie, or what you\'re billing as a movie, except it\'s already on cable and I figure a month from now it\'ll be in one of those Redbox things. And it\'s called Heist, I guess because it wants to separate me from my money.',negative
'There\'s actually a not-too bad caper plot underneath the incoherent over-direction from Mann.',negative
'Whether or not one should tamper in God\'s domain remains a matter of opinion, but Victor Frankenstein provides evidence that mere mortals should not mess with what Ms. Shelley hath wrought.',negative
'The cast is solid, game, competent. And the you can\'t fault an audience for seeking a little female victimhood/female empowerment in their romantic thrillers.',negative
'Agent 47 is just slightly less dull than its disavowed predecessor \' or at least its dullness seems less active, because it doesn\'t turn anyone as inherently interesting as Olyphant into a dour-faced killing machine.',negative
'A film about as funny as a seeping wound.',negative
'The movie left me amazed \' amazed that Nicolas Cage wasn\'t in it.',negative
